<p>This page illustrates characteristics feature of various types of regulators used in molecular simulations to maintain the temperature and pressure of the system.</p>
<p>The text will make references to DL_POLY but it is also applicable to other packages.</p>
<img alt="../../_images/Orange_bar.png" src="../../_images/Orange_bar.png" />
<p>There is a range of integration techniques available in DL_POLY and other MD packages to bring
and maintain a model system on <strong>N</strong> particles to a targeted volume
(<strong>V</strong>), energy (<strong>E</strong>) or temperature (<strong>T</strong>) via <em>NVE</em>
(microcanonical) and <em>NVT</em> (canonical) ensembles, and pressure (<strong>P</strong>)
via <em>NPT</em> and <em>NsT</em> (isobaric-isothermal) ensembles.</p>
<p>Thermostats help drive the model system to the desired target
temperature, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{target}\)</span>, and need a user-specified relaxation time or
a friction frequency, depending on its definition within the equations
of motion. Barostats help drive the system to the desired target
pressure, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{target}\)</span>, and also need a user-specified relaxation time
or a friction frequency, depending on its definition within the
equations of motion. These time-related constants regulate the eagerness
with which the thermostat and/or barostat (collectively called the
‘system regulators’) apply control onto the system in order to maintain
its temperature and/or pressure (collectively called the ‘system
parameters’) to the desired targeted values (thermodynamic state). In
general, the larger the value of the relaxation time (the smaller the
frction frequency), the slower the response of the regulators to
maintain the targeted parameters.</p>
<p>If the relaxation time is too large then the integrator will allow the
system to relax but it will be difficult to maintain the desired system
parameters close to their targeted values. This could lead to the system
responding more slowly to fluctuations in the system parameters or
obtaining values offset from the targeted values.</p>
<p>If the relaxation time is too small the integrator will maintain the
system parameter too vigorously and it may not allow the system to relax
properly or even lead to large uncontrolled fluctuations of the system
regulators around their targeted values.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>There are no unique ‘ideal values’ for the relaxation times: their
choice is dependent on the type of system being modelled and the nature
of the regulators (equation of motions). However, for many atomistic
systems a typical value for a thermostat relaxation time is within the
interval of <strong>0.2 to 2.0 ps</strong> (e.g. <strong>0.75 ps</strong>) and a typical value for a
barostat relaxation time is within the interval of <strong>0.5 to 4.0 ps</strong>.
(e.g. <strong>1.5 ps</strong>).</p>
</div>
<p>Check the temperature of the system in the <em>STATIS</em> or <em>OUTPUT</em> file to see if
you are happy with the temperature and pressure fluctuations.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that not all integrators generate correct ensembles
and hence not all of them can sample correctly the equilibrium or be
used correctly for non-equilibrium simulations. However, all of them
have their own uses and it is generally a matter of preference which one
should be used, especially for equilibration.</p>
<section id="temperature-rescale">
<h2>Temperature rescale<a class="headerlink" href="#temperature-rescale" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another way to maintain the temperature of the system is by using
brute-force rescaling of the particle velocities to maintain precisely
the specified target temperature (given in the <em>CONTROL</em> file) at
user-specified intervals of time. This option is only recommended for
equilibrating the system at the initial stage. Since this option
interferes with the integrators’ temperature fluctuations, the forced
dynamics do not correspond to any ensemble dynamics and any properties
measured while using this option should not be used for system sampling.</p>
<p>Temperature rescaling will be activated in DL_POLY by using the
directive <em>equilibration</em>. Such rescaling only applies while the MD
timestep number is less than the specified number of <em>equilibration</em>
steps in the <em>CONTROL</em> file. Once the timestep number exceeds the number
of <em>equilibration</em> steps (i.e. when the number of <em>steps</em> is larger),
only then are the system regulators from the selected integrator applied.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Example below shows an example how to apply brute-force temperature rescale
effect in the DL_POLY <em>CONTROL</em> file:</p>
<p><em>steps 80000</em></p>
<p><em>equilibration steps 50000</em></p>
<p>This means brute-force scaling temperature applies for the first 50,000 steps.
After that, the selected system regulators apply for the remaining 30,000 steps.</p>
</div>
</section>
<section id="types-of-system-regulators">
<h2>Types of system regulators<a class="headerlink" href="#types-of-system-regulators" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Different types of system regulators have different characteristics that
perform suitably depending on the system types. There is a vague
consensus, often with weak scientific argument but largely an empirical
‘community-led’ preference, to choose one type over the others. The
preferred type for equilibration purposes is the Berendsen thermostat as
it controls each particle velocity directly down to target temperature.
This could lead to ‘the flying icecube’ effect if no control is
exercised to the centre of mass motion gathered by this algorithm.
However, this undesired effect is counteracted by default in DL_POLY.</p>
<p>Two broad types of system regulators are <strong>deterministic</strong> and
<strong>stochastic</strong>. From a given initial state, deterministic regulators act
consistently (at least to machine precision) on a system regardless of
how a simulation is run.</p>
<p>Stochastic regulators depend upon the use of pseudorandom number
generators, whose setup may affect the results of a simulation. That
said, (i) generators and their initial states can be selected to give
consistent results for different runs, and (ii) regulators with
correctly defined dynamics should give statistically similar results
even for runs with different generator setups.</p>

<section id="evans-thermostat">
<h3>Evans thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#evans-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the particles in the system to a heat
‘bath’ via a kinetic temperature constraint that generates a
self-adjusting velocity (kinetic) friction. It generates a proper
<em>NVEkin</em> ensemble and can be used for systems with a steady flow. It
can be used for equilibration. It is suitable for soft condensed matter
systems such as liquids.</p>
</section>
<section id="langevin-thermostat">
<h3>Langevin thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#langevin-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the system to a coupled viscous
background (with a user-defined kinetic friction) and a <strong>stochastic</strong>
heat ‘bath’ (with random frictional forces). The effect of the algorithm
is to thermostat that system on a local scale – ‘cold’ particles are
given energy whereas ‘hot’ particles are cooled down. It generates a
proper <em>NVT</em> ensemble. It is suitable for soft condensed matter systems
such as fluids and such with varying density. The thermostat is suitable
for biological systems (e.g. proteins and water) as well as solids in
condensed phase. It can use larger time steps than other thermostats.
The thermostat adds a random centre of mass motion that has zero mean,
i.e. there will not be a long-term drift of the centre of mass.</p>
<p>The damping effects apply on the particles means there is a lost of momentum transfer.
Therefore, diffusion coefficients cannot be determined when applying the Langevin thermostat.</p>
</section>
<section id="andersen-thermostat">
<h3>Andersen thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#andersen-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It randomly selects particles and replaces
their velocities with values <strong>randomly</strong> chosen from a
Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution for the target temperature.
<strong>Stochastic</strong> collision operator determines the number of particles
whose velocities are replaced. The thermostat is not a true <em>NVT</em>
ensemble. However, it is still suitable and popular for soft condensed
matter systems such as fluids and biological, provide it is not used for
the calculation of exact dynamical properties. If no care is taken the
original algorithm may lead to centre of mass drift. However, this is
counteracted in all modern versions of the algorithm.</p>
</section>
<section id="berendsen-thermostat">
<h3>Berendsen thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#berendsen-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the system to a virtual heat ‘bath’
via a brute force velocity rescaling, only moderated by the relaxation
time parameter. Suitable for equilibration. However, its direct
rescaling of velocities results in wrong equipartition of energy
components that leads to systematic global motion of the system (flying
ice cube). This effect is counteracted nowadays but it does not sample
correctly the <em>NVT</em> ensemble and as such is non-ergodic. In general, it
is thought the Berendsen approach is quite suitable for equilibration
purposes (e.g. a steep descent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{target}\)</span>) but not recommended for
sampling. Although, if a system is well defined by a model and in
equilibrium, all integrators should generate the same energies and
virials.</p>
</section>
<section id="nose-hoover-thermostat">
<h3>Nosé-Hoover thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#nose-hoover-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It defines a mass for the heat ‘bath’
governed by the relaxation parameter. It results in slow, decreasing
fluctuations of the system kinetic energy towards the desired
<span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{target}\)</span>. It samples the <em>NVT</em> (canonical ensemble) and is
considered the gold standard by many communities. It is suitable for all
condensed matter systems (liquids, solutions, biological systems).</p>
</section>
<section id="gst-thermostat">
<h3>GST thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#gst-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Gentle Stochastic Thermostat (GST) is an
extension on the Nosé-Hoover thermostat in which the Nosé-Hoover
thermostat friction has its own Brownian dynamics, governed by a
Langevin friction. The GST samples the <em>NVT</em> (canonical ensemble) and is
considered the new gold standard. It is the only ensemble that warrants
ergodicity by construction and thus is suitable for all model systems.</p>
</section>
<section id="dpd-thermostat">
<h3>DPD thermostat<a class="headerlink" href="#dpd-thermostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) is a pairwise
generalised form of the Langevin thermostat. It applies random (‘heat
bath’) and frictional (viscous) forces to pairs of particles within a
cutoff. It conserves both system-wide and local momentum and is thus
Galilean invariant, i.e. it does not produce global motion (flying ice
cube) for static systems while providing correct hydrodynamic
behaviours when flow fields are applied. Dissipative (friction) force terms
can be related to fluid viscosity and self-diffusivity, although these
relationships are complex and are affected by particle interactions. It can
use larger time steps than other thermostats. It is suitable for soft
condensed matter systems (including those with flow fields) at coarse
grain length scales, intended for mesoscopic (DPD) simulations.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>To obtain equilibration as quickly as possible in DPD simulations, the dissipative force parameter <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\gamma\)</span> is often set to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(4.5 \frac{k_B T \tau}{r_c^2}\)</span> (where <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(k_B T\)</span>, <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(\tau\)</span> and <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(r_c\)</span> are the selected energy, time and length scales for the simulation). This value corresponds to a minimum fluid viscosity and maximum diffusivity when no interaction forces are in use.</p>

</section>
<section id="berendsen-barostat">
<h3>Berendsen barostat<a class="headerlink" href="#berendsen-barostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the system to a virtual external
pressure ‘bath’ by rescaling the simulation volume and particle
positions according to how far the instantaneous pressure is from the
target value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{target}\)</span>. The scaling factor is related to the ratio
of the system isothermal compressibility and the barostat relaxation
time parameter. DL_POLY uses the isothermal compressibility of liquid
water as a representative value for the barostat. The Berendsen barostat
is often used along with the Berendsen thermostat (as in DL_POLY) to
generate constant pressure and temperature (e.g. <em>NPT</em>) ensembles,
although it can be coupled with other thermostats (e.g. with DPD in DL_MESO).
In general, it is thought the Berendsen approach is quite suitable for
equilibration purposes (e.g. a steep ascent or descent to <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{target}\)</span>)
but not recommended for sampling.</p>
</section>
<section id="langevin-barostat">
<h3>Langevin barostat<a class="headerlink" href="#langevin-barostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the system to a virtual piston, which
moves according to how far instantaneous pressure is from the target
value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{target}\)</span>. The piston is also coupled to a viscous background
with a user-defined kinetic friction and a stochastic heat ‘bath’ with
random frictional forces. The piston mass and the kinetic friction are
both determined from a barostat relaxation time parameter, while the
random frictional forces are scaled according to the barostat kinetic friction
and target system temperature <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(T_{target}\)</span>. The Langevin barostat is
often used along with the Langevin thermostat (as in DL_POLY) to
generate constant pressure and temperature (e.g. <em>NPT</em>) ensembles, or it can
Be coupled with the DPD thermostat as in DL_MESO. It
can frequently obtain the target pressure more quickly than other
barostats and reduce correlation times for sampling of system
properties.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>Care needs to be taken when selecting the Langevin barostat relaxation time parameter, particularly for the choice of piston mass. Overly large values can decouple the barostat and particle dynamics (leading to inefficient sampling), while too small values can disturb the particle dynamics. The optimum value normally has to be chosen by trial-and-error, although a rule of thumb suggests the resulting frequency of volume fluctuations should be around ten times smaller than the thermostat frequency (related to its kinetic friction parameter). In turn, a good choice for barostat kinetic friction is between half and one tenth of the volume fluctuation frequency.</p>

<section id="nose-hoover-barostat">
<h3>Nosé-Hoover barostat<a class="headerlink" href="#nose-hoover-barostat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>It couples the system to a virtual external
pressure ‘bath’, whose mass is governed by the relaxation parameter. It
rescales simulation volume and particle positions, using how far the
instantaneous pressure is from the target value <span class="math notranslate nohighlight">\(P_{target}\)</span> to evolve
the rescaling factor. Coupled with the Nosé-Hoover thermostat, it
samples <em>NPT</em> and other isobaric-isothermal ensembles. It is suitable
for all condensed matter systems (liquids, solutions, biological
systems), although it only acts correctly for larger simulations. An
extended form of this barostat with further connections to the
thermostat – the <strong>Martyna-Tuckerman-Klein barostat</strong> – overcomes this
restriction.</p>
