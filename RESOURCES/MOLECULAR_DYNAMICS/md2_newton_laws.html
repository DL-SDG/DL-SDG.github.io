The equations show in the main text are basically a set of standard kinematic equation you learnt in secondary schools<br />
<br />
v = u + at <br />
r = r0 + vt <br/>
<br />
where a is the acceleration, u is the initial velocity and v is the velocity after time t. Once v is determined, then we could update the position from r0 to r over time t.
<br />
<br />
From Newton's second law<br />
F = ma<br />
where F is the force exerts on the object and m is the mass of the object. And so<br />
<br />
v = u +Ft/m
