Atom typing is a procedure to detect the type of an atom within a molecular system. From such, suitable potential parameters will be selected. 
<br /><br />
There is no rule how to carry out atom typing. The procedure can vary widely from one FF scheme to another. DL_FIELD can carry out detailed analysis to decide the actual chemical nature of every atom in the system for a wide range of FF scheme in a consistent fashion.
