The Molecular Group (also called the Molecule Group) is a DL_FIELD jargon. It is a name or label given to a group of atoms and molecules in a system configuration. It is a convenient way to differentiate different classes of molecules in the system.
<br /><br />
For example, in a solution model, solute molecules can be grouped in a Molecular Group that is different from that of solvent molecules. Subsequently, two groups of molecules will be defined in DL_POLY's <i>FIELD</i> file. The Molecular Group names will appear as the <i>molecules</i> directive and ends with a <i>finish</i> directive in the <i>FIELD</i> file. Obviously, no direct chemical bond is allowed between two different Molecular Groups.
