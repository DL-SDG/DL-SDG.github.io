The ATOM_TYPE is a DL_FIELD-specific notation. It is the name of an ATOM, often in a human-readable form.
Note that an element can have a number of different chemical behaviour, depending on its chemical environment or
how it is bonded within a molecule.
<br /><br />
For this reason, an element can have many different ATOM_TYPEs. For example, C_ketone is an ATOM_TYPE, which refers to the carbonyl carbon of the ketone functional group. C_ester is another ATOM_TYPE of carbon, which refers to the carbonyl carbon of the ester functional group. 
<br /><br />
In DL_FIELD, some form of atom typing procedures would be needed to decide the ATOM_TYPE of an atom. From such, suitable force field parameters will be assigned for the atom.
