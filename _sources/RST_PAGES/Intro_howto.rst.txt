As you work your way through the material available in the resource centre you will find variously coloured boxes like those shown below:

.. Note::
   These are grey boxes describing important pieces of information of which the user should be aware.

.. Warning::
   These are pale red boxes describing information that should not be ignored!

:TIP:
   These are (hopefully!) helpful hints to enable ease-of-use or understanding. They are marked by the presence of a pale purple box that extends down the left hand side of the page aligned with the text.

This is the 'Further Reading' icon indicating extra material that you might find useful, but that is not essential for the new user.
