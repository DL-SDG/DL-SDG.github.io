Anisotropic constant pressure MD
================================

Summary
-------

This exercise studies a well-known phase transition in potassium chloride, see ref. [Parrinello1981]_, using constant pressure
molecular dynamics. The objective is to develop the best practice in using such algorithms and to learn how
phase transitions can be induced, detected and monitored in a simulation.

Background
----------

Potassium chloride at ambient temperature and pressure adopts the cubic rocksalt structure, in which each ion
is surrounded by six ions of opposite charge in an octahedral arrangement. Under high pressure this structure
transforms to something more close packed - the so-called caesium chloride structure, where the nearest
neighbour coordination rises to eight ions. (Using the model potential adopted here, this occurs at about 1.4
GPa.)
In this exercise the student will have the opportunity to see this phase transition using the method of anisotropic
constant pressure molecular dynamics. Commencing with the rocksalt crystal structure and applying a fixed
external pressure it is possible to induce the phase transition in a simulation. Similarly it is possible to see
the reverse transition back to rocksalt. However it is not necessarily trivial to make these transitions happen
in any given simulation (though you may be lucky the first time!) Your task will be to find the conditions
under which the phase transition occurs. This will not be entirely a matter of finding the right conditions of
temperature and pressure, but will also involve setting up the control parameters for the simulation so as to
encourage the phase transition to occur. (Even if the transformation is thermodynamically permitted, it does
not follow that it will happen in the lifetime of a simulation.)

Task
-----

First download the :download:`FIELD <./FIELD>`, :download:`CONTROL <./CONTROL>`, :download:`CONFIG <./CONFIG>` files. 
The last of these is a crystal of potassium chloride at ambient temperature and pressure (i.e. in the 
rocksalt structure). You should proceed as follows:

#. Load the *CONTROL* file in your favourite text editor. Select the constant stress barostat – see ensemble,
   and set appropriate relaxation times for the thermostat and barostat. Choose an appropriate starting
   temperature and pressure and run a reference simulation of the system at ambient
   temperature and pressure (i.e. set DLPOLY.Z running - 2000 time steps is quite sufficient). Examine the
   resulting *OUTPUT* file and display the final *REVCON* file and simulation RDFs to see what structure you
   have.
#. Repeat the simulation at a different state point, where you might expect a phase transition to occur.
   Examine the result graphically once again (using the *REVCON* file and a visualiser such as VMD) and try to 
   deduce how the phase transition occurred. Look at the RDF plots (which can be generated from the *RDFDAT* output file) and try to determine what phase the 
   structure is now in.
#. If you do not see a phase transition, experiment with the control parameters (e.g. change the relaxation
   times, temperature or pressure, as you think fit) until you see one. Be as systematic as you can, using
   whatever insight you gain to rationalise what’s going on.
#. If you believe that you have obtained the phase transition, a number of other options are open to you:

   * Look in the *STATIS* or *OUTPUT* files (details in the manual) and see if the variables catalogued there
     can provide an independent ‘signature’ of the phase transition.
   * Continue to experiment with the control parameters and see how the system responds, thereby
     strengthening your understanding about how to ‘drive’ the program. Try some of the other ensembles available.
   * Explore the phase diagram at little more (change T and P). Try and obtain the reverse transition.
