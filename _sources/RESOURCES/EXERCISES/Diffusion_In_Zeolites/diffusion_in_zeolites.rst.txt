Diffusion in Zeolites
=====================

Summary
-------

Zeolites, which have complex *cage* structures of silica and aluminium,
are extremely important in industrial catalysis. In this exercise, the
diffusion of an aromatic compound (benzene) in a model zeolite is
studied, see . Diffusion rates are extremely slow in these systems, so a
simple trick will be employed to attempt to improve matters.

Background
----------

In this exercise the silicalite-1 structure is used as a model for the
zeolite ZSM-5, which has application in synthesizing stereospecific
aromatic derivatives. The process has (at least) two aspects to it:
firstly the aromatic species must diffuse into the zeolite and secondly
it must undergo catalytic reaction within the confines of the zeolite
cages. (It is believed that the confinement within the cages is
responsible for the sterospecificity of the reactions.)

Classical simulation cannot study the reaction process, but it is
(usually) well suited to model the diffusion. The problem in this case
however is that the diffusion is slow and it is difficult to get
accurate estimates of the diffusion constant. There are a number of ways
this can be overcome, perhaps the most promising of which is to use
constraint dynamics (see exercise :ref:`ex:pmf`) to obtain the
activation energy and feed this into a numerical model of the diffusion,
ref [Forester1997]_, this however is beyond the scope of these exercises. Instead we shall
employ a less rigorous approach, that has been used in studies of
diffusion in amorphous polymers, ref [Plathe1991]_. In this it is assumed that diffusion
is governed by Arrhenius like behaviour:

.. math:: D(λ)=D_0e^{-λ\frac{E_A}{RT}}

where :math:`E_A` is an activation energy and :math:`λ` is a scaling
factor between 0 and 1. The origin of the activation energy lies in the
intermolecular interactions, and thus the factor :math:`λ` is a control
parameter governing the strength of these. We hope that by reducing the
intermolecular interaction, we may effectively increase the measured
diffusion constant :math:`D(λ)` and later obtain the true diffusion
constant (which corresponds to the case where :math:`λ = 1`) by
extrapolation.


Task
----
Download the files: :download:`FIELD <./FIELD>`, :download:`CONTROL <./CONTROL>`, :download:`CONFIG <./CONFIG>`.
The *CONFIG* file contains
a silicalite framework and a benzene molecule inserted into one of the
cavities. The *FIELD* file contains the appropriate description of all
the interactions (note this is a *stripped down* forcefield constructed
for the workshop, and is **not guaranteed** for other uses!) Proceed as
follows:

#. Visualise the original configuration using a program such as VMD. If you are not
   familiar with zeolite structures, it will be interesting for you to
   see what this one looks like! The structure is characterised by large
   inteconnecting cavities forming channels for the diffusion of
   penetrant molecules.

#. Run a simulation for about 2000 timesteps, creating a
   *HISTORY* file. To save disc space, you should dump configurations
   only every 10 timesteps and should not dump atomic velocities at all.
   Look at the calculated diffusion coefficients in the *OUTPUT* file
   which will give you an idea of what you are up against.

#. Edit the *FIELD* file using your favourite editor, reducing the
   strength of the interaction between the benzene and zeolite by some
   factor :math:`λ` with :math:`0< λ < 1` (this will involve Van der
   Waals terms only) and repeat the simulation to obtain the MSD and
   diffusion constant again. Do this at least two more times. (Note each
   simulation may take up to an hour.)

#. Plot the log of the diffusion constants against the parameter
   :math:`λ`. Can you estimate the diffusion constant at :math:`λ=1`?
   How does it compare with your first run?

In each simulation you should look at the *REVCON* files produced by
the DL_POLY run and see where the benzene has ended up. If it has
changed *channels* in the zeolite, what effect do you think this might
have on the the study overall? Try to form an opinion on how useful this
approach is likely to be as a general technique.
