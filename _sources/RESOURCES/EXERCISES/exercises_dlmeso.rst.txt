DL_MESO
*****************

Below is a list of tutorial exercises that have been written for a range of users of DL_MESO. They are categorized according to mesoscale modelling method: Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). Some guidance on setting up DL_MESO for the exercises is also provided.

The exercises are not intended to be step-by-step walkthroughs: not all of the tasks need to be completed, but some thought and experimentation may be required to get the most out of an exercise.
