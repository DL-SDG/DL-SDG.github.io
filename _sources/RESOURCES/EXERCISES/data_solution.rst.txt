Solution model analysis
***********************

Below lists a number of simulation trajectories produced from DL_POLY. By using these as input structures, D_ATA can analyse and identify atomic interactions present in the systems.

Note that since they are of different systems, each can only be analysed one at a time.


(a) Acetone in water (:download:`xyz format <./acetone_water.xyz.gz>`). A system model consist of 30 acetone (propanone) molecules in water to give a total of 6408 atoms. Atom index 1 to 300 belongs to the 30 acetone molecules. Atom index 301 to 6408 belongs to water molecules.

(b) Pure pentanoic acid liquid (:download:`xyz format <./pentanoic_acid.xyz.gz>`). A system model consists of 2808 pentanoic acid molecules, with a total of 47736 atoms.

(c) Ethylacetate in water (:download:`DL_POLY trajectory <./HISTORY_ea_water.gz>`). Twenty ethylacetate molecules dissolve in 2040 water molecules. Atom index 1 to 280 belongs to the organic molecule and atom index 281 to 6400 belongs to water molecules.

**Procedures**

(1) Compile D_ATA program.

(2) Select and download trajectory file. Save the file to your D_ATA home directory (where *d_ata* executable file is located).

(3) Edit and insert the filename of the downloaded trajectory file in *d_ata.input*, as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: data_solution1.txt

where XXX is the filename of the downloaded trajectory. For example, *acetone_water.xyz.gz*.
If your trajectory file is located in other folder, then remember to specify the path as well.

If your D_ATA version cannot read the gzip compressed file, then use *gunzip* to uncompress it and change the filename accordingly.

Save and exit *d_ata.input*.

(4) Edit and view the *d_ata.control* file. Select the options as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: data_solution2.txt

Save and exit *d_ata.control*.

(5) Run D_ATA program at the home directory by simply type *./d_ata*


(6) Upon finish running the analysis, the following files will be produced in the OUTPUT_PATH folder:

- *d_ata.output*

- *d_ata.csf*

- *d_ata.results*

- A number of count-time profile files (*count_XXX.results*), if any. See *d_ata.results* for details.

(7) Change control options such as number of atoms to analysis, analysis criteria, etc and rerun D_ATA. 

Please refer to manual or :doc:`../TUTORIALS/data_0` reference guide for more information on how to interpret output results.
