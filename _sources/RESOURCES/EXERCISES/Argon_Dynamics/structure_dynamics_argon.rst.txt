Structure and Dynamics of Argon
===============================

Summary
-------

In this the structural and dynamical properties of liquid argon are
studied. The radial distribution function (RDF) and structure factor,
:math:`S(k)`, are used to extract the mean or static structure, and the
mean squared displacement (MSD), van Hove self correlation function,
:math:`G_s(r,t)`, see ref [Hove1954]_, and dynamic structure factor, :math:`S(k,ω)` are
used to examine dynamical properties.

Background
----------

Liquid argon was one of the first liquids to be studied by molecular
dynamics, ref [Rahman1964]_, on account of its alleged simplicity. As this exercise will
show however, even simple liquids have complex properties. In this
exercise we shall use some fairly typical ways of investigating the
properties of liquids, beginning with probably the simplest: the radial
distribution function. Next we shall look at diffusion by computing the
mean squared displacement and seek to explain the mechanism of this
using the van Hove self correlation function. Finally we shall calculate
the dynamic structure factor and determine the velocity of sound in the
liquid and from that estimate the elastic modulus.

Task
----

Copy or download the following files:  :download:`CONFIG <./CONFIG>` :download:`FIELD <./FIELD>` :download:`CONTROL <./CONTROL>`
The *CONFIG* file contains
a typical argon liquid configuration simulated at 85 K. Proceed as
follows:

#. Take a look at the DL_POLY input data files *CONTROL*, *FIELD*
   and *CONFIG*. Make sure you understand what these files do. 
   Run the simulation, when complete DL_POLY will have generated a 
   large *HISTORY*.

#. Use the generated *RDFDAT* file to plot the RDF for the system.
   Study the RDF and try to relate it to the force field specification
   in the *FIELD* file. You should understand the meaning of the
   features of the RDF, for instance: is the RDF liquid-like? The
   structure factor is obtained in a similar way using the :math:`S(k)`
   option and works by calculating a Fourier transform of the RDF data.
   This function is of course related to the experimental determination
   of the RDF by x-ray or neutron scattering. An interesting question is
   how much can you believe the results at low k vector. Can you think
   of a way to investigate this?

#. Write a script to calculate and plot the MSD
   directly from the *HISTORY* file (set it to run over 2800
   configurations). From this estimate the
   diffusion constant. Note the MSD at short time is not linear, why is
   this?

#. The next issue is the nature of the diffusion. Two mechanisms suggest
   themselves: are the atoms are hopping from place to place or they are
   following a continuous random walk without ‘resting’ in any
   particular place. We all know it is the latter, but how? Use the Van Hove self
   correlation function to see how the
   self correlation varies with time. How does this show that the
   diffusion is a continuous random walk?

#. Finally calculate the dynamic structure factor :math:`S(k,ω)` with :math:`kmax=2`. 
   Plot the various functions :math:`S(k,ω)` in which :math:`k` is fixed and
   :math:`ω` is the ordinate. Locate the Brillouin peak (if any)
   appearing in some of these functions. From the (approximate) position
   of this peak determine the velocity of sound in the liquid. Next
   attempt to determine the elastic modulus associated with this using
   the Newtonian rule that the velocity of sound (c) is equal to the
   square root of the ratio of the elastic modulus (:math:`γ`) to the
   density (:math:`ρ`) i.e.

    .. math:: c=\sqrt{\frac{γ}{ρ}}

Check the result for more than one :math:`k` vector. Do the results agree? What
does the result mean in terms of the bulk properties of the liquid?
