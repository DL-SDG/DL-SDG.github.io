Atomic Interaction Analysis Using D_ATA
=======================================

This page is related to the tutorial section to setup a solution model using DL_FIELD. If you have not done so, please go to
:doc:`dlf_solution`.

If you have not run the simulation to produce the HISTORY trajectory file, please go to :doc:`dlf_run`.

Otherwise, continue on as follows:

We are now going to determine types of hydrogen bond (HB) interactions present in the system by using D_ATA to analyse the *HISTORY* file produced from the previous tutorial.


**Procedures**

(1) Edit D_ATA input file (*d_ata.input*) and insert *HISTORY* as the input file:

.. literalinclude:: dlf_analyse_control1.txt

Close and save the file.

(2) Use this control file (*d_ata.control*) as shown below:

.. literalinclude:: dlf_analyse_control2.txt

(3) Run D_ATA by typing *./d_ata* 

(4) Inspect output files: *d_ata.output* and *d_ata.results*.
