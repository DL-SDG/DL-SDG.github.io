Setup solutions
********************

This exercise shows how to use DL_FIELD to setup a solution model by using the :doc:`../TUTORIALS/dlf_6`. 

Below lists a number of small drug molecules (solutes). They are all
nosteroidal anti-flammatory drug molecules. For this exercise we will solvate these drug molecules with a solvent of your choice. The OPLS2005 FF scheme will be used to setup FF files for DL_POLY. 

* :download:`Aspirin <../STRUCTURES/aspirin.xyz>`

* :download:`Ibuprofen <../STRUCTURES/ibuprofen.xyz>`

* :download:`Mefenamic acid <../STRUCTURES/mefenamic_acid.xyz>`

**Procedures**

(1) Download or save one of the drug molecules as shown above into a filename that ends with .xyz, to indicate to DL_FIELD it is in *xyz* format. Save this in DL_FIELD home directory (where the *dl_field* executable file is located).

(2) Edit DL_FIELD control file (for example, *dl_field.control*). Insert the correct options as highlighted below: 

.. literalinclude:: dlf_control.txt 
   :emphasize-lines: 4, 11, 13, 26, 28, 29, 30, 31, 36, 43 

The options selected will instruct DL_FIELD to setup FF models using OPLS2005 FF scheme. DL_FIELD will duplicate the number of molecule to give the solute concentration of 0.4 mol/dm^2 and each solute must be at least 8 angstrom apart from one another.

The simulation box size is 40x40x40 angstrom. The H-bond constrains are also applied for the molecules.

Once the solute is duplicated, DL_FIELD will introduce ethanol (etoh) solvent molecules, which must be at least 1.3 angstrom from solutes.

**Remember to check dl_f_path is pointing to the right control file you are using.**

(3) Run DL_FIELD (*./dl_field*). Once successfully run, DL_FIELD will produce the following files: The *dl_poly.CONFIG* and *dl_poly.FIELD* files. 

(4) Take a look at output files (dl_field.output), which provides information about the conversion. Take a look also dlf_notation.output, which shows the atom typing information, in DL_F Notation.

(5) Congratulations! You have just setup a solution model.

(6) If you wish, you can proceed: :doc:`dlf_run`. 

(7) Otherwise, you can choose other solvents and run step (2) again. Solvent list is available in the *solvent/* folder.

.. Note::
  You can also use this exercise to set up FF models for other packages such as GROMACS or LAMMPS. All you need to do is to select either *gromacs* or *lammps* in second option of the DL_FIELD *control* file.
