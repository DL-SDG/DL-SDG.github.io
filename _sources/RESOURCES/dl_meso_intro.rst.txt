DL_MESO is a general-purpose mesoscale simulation software package.

**Functions**

1. Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) simulations of two- and three-dimensional systems

   * Multiple interacting fluids 
   * Mass and heat transfers coupled to fluid flows
   * Wide range of boundary conditions

2. Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD) simulations of mesoscopic particles ('beads')

   * Galilean-invariant thermostats (DPD and others)
   * Wide variety of interaction types, e.g. many-body DPD, bonded interactions and electrostatics
   * Non-periodic systems available with frozen beads, hard reflecting surfaces and linear shear

3. Domain decomposition parallelisation strategy for both methods and codes, allowing simulation of model sizes that are limited to computer memories.

4. OpenMP multithreading available to speed up computationally intensive sections of simulations.

5. Self-contained, free-formatted C++ and Fortran 2003 codes (with MPI2 and/or OpenMP), can run on most computer platforms - single-processor PC to multi-processor supercomputers.
