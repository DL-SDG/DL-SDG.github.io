This page shows you how to use DL_POLY to acheive specific tasks. Please note that there may be many other alternative ways to achieve certain tasks, depending on the system states and types of systems. We only show a general guide below.

**How to equilibrate a system**

The initial system that you set up, either by DL_FIELD or some other means, is likely to be far from an equilibrium state. Almost all systems need to be equilibrated before a sampling run can be carried out.

(1) Tame down a 'drastic' intial configuration.

The example *CONTROL* files below can be used to relax high-energy molecular systems: for example, atoms that are too close to each other.

.. literalinclude:: ./dl_poly_control1new.dat

**CONTROL file for newer versions of DL_POLY (DL_POLY_5)**


.. literalinclude:: ./dl_poly_control1.dat 

**CONTROL file for older versions of DL_POLY (DL_POLY_4 and earlier)** 


The following list provides the relevant directives (given in parentheses for older DL_POLY versions) that are crucial to control the system:

*ensemble nve* - you will not want to change the box size at this stage. Disentanglement of high-energy conformations is crucial at this stage.

*equilibration_force_cap* (*cap*) - cap the force to or less than the value specified, in units of kT/angstrom. This is to prevent atoms from 'flying off' uncontrollably.

*reset_temperature_interval* (*zero*) - perform a 'zero temperature' run. In practice, DL_POLY actually rescales the whole system to exactly 10 K: there will otherwise be no dynamics whatsoever!

*time_run* (*steps*) - total number of steps to be carried out. More steps may be needed if a large conformational change is required.

*time_equilibration* (*equilibration steps*) - total number of MD steps to be carried out to rescale the temperature (to 10 K in this case). For this equilibration stage, make sure this value is always larger than the total number of steps given by *time_run* (*steps*).

*rescale_frequency 1 steps* (*scale every 1*) - the temperature will be rescaled at every MD step: you will not want any uncontrollable temperature spikes.

*timestep_variable* (*variable timestep*) - DL_POLY will choose the optimum timestep while ensuring system stability. The timestep value provided (0.000001 ps) is the minimum permissible timestep: reduce this number if required.

.. Note:: 
   Take a note of the system energy to obtain a good indication that the *CONTROL* file is doing its job properly. For systems containing polar molecules, the energy can drastically reduce from large positive values to negative values within a few MD steps. However, if the energy is reducing continously, you are in good hands.

(2) A less drastic, controlled equilibration

The above *CONTROL* file only permits very small movements of atoms. To speed up the dynamics, the parameters can be changed to allow faster dynamics, yet still in a controlled manner. The below changes to the above CONTROL file are recommended:

* Gradually increase the value of capping forces (*equilibration_force_cap* or *cap*) to, say, 3000.0 or 5000.0, or even remove it entirely.

* Remove the *reset_temperature_interval* (*zero*) directive. When this is done, DL_POLY will continue to rescale the temperature of the system to the value specified by the directive *temperature* in the *CONTROL* file. It is best to start with a value close to 10 K, e.g. 50 K, before gradually increasing the temeprature to the desired temperature (normally 300.0 K).

.. Note::
   There is no rule to say what is an ideal heating rate for the system. Typically, you can increase 50.0 K every 50,000 MD steps or so.

.. Note:: 
   Remember to make a *copy* of the *CONFIG* file after each run from its *REVCON* file to ensure the latest *CONFIG* file is used for the next run. To continue the simulation after changing the above-mentioned values, remember to use the *restart* directive in the *CONTROL* file and increase the *time_run* (*step*) value. 

(3) Carry out a normal equilibration 

Once the configuration energy has settled down or if your intial configuration is now in a low energy state, you can carry out a normal equilibration procedure in the NVE ensemble, using the example *CONTROL* files shown below:

.. literalinclude:: ./dl_poly_control2new.dat
   
**CONTROL file for newer versions of DL_POLY (DL_POLY_5)** 

.. literalinclude:: ./dl_poly_control2.dat

**CONTROL file for older versions of DL_POLY (DL_POLY_4 and earlier)** 


The simulation can run without any additional simulation constraints for as long as is needed. The system is said to be equilibrated if the energy of the system fluctuates around some mean (average) value.

Once the system is sufficiently equilibrated, you can remove the temperature scaling in the NVE ensemble by resetting the value of *time_equilibration* (*equilibration steps*) to zero, e.g.:

| *time_equilibration* 0 *steps*

Since the total number of MD steps (*time_run* or *steps*) is now larger than the number of equilibration steps, DL_POLY will no longer enforce temperature rescaling on the system. A stable system should be able to remain at more or less the same temperature as before, even without temperature rescaling. 

.. Warning::
   Whenever you change the *timestep* value, do not use the *restart continue* (*restart*) directive, but use *restart noscale* instead. In other words, you can only change your *timestep* once for each simulation. Whenever you change the timestep value, you will need to start the simulation afresh. The *restart noscale* directive ensures the simulation starts from the beginning with the initial velocities of the system derived from the *CONFIG* file. Once the simulation is complete, it can continue on as usual by using *restart continue* (*restart*).

(4) Running NVT equilibration

In the *CONTROL* file, you can change the ensemble to an NVT one with a Berendsen thermostat. For newer DL_POLY versions, replace the *ensemble nve* line in *CONTROL* with:

| *ensemble nvt*
| *ensemble_method berendsen*
| *ensemble_thermostat_coupling 0.4 ps*

while for older DL_POLY versions, replace the *ensemble nve* line with:

| *ensemble nvt berendsen 0.4*

Remember to use *restart noscale* to restart the simulation and set the MD time back to zero. You can continue the simuation until the energy of the system fluctuates around some contant value over a period of time. 

(5) Running NPT equilibration (equilibrate system box)

At this stage, the molecular configuration is properly equilibrated but the system box might not be. In the *CONTROL* file, you can change the ensemble to NPT (constant pressure) and specify a target system pressure to automatically rescale the box size. For newer versions of DL_POLY, change the *ensemble* directives to:

| *ensemble npt*
| *ensemble_method hoover*
| *ensemble_thermostat_coupling 0.4 ps*
| *ensemble_barostat_coupling 1.0 ps*

while for older DL_POLY versions, change the *ensemble* directive in the *CONTROL* file to:

| *ensemble npt hoover 0.4 1.0*   

The pressure also needs to be specified in the *CONTROL* file, using:

| *pressure_hydrostatic 0.001 katm*

for newer DL_POLY versions or:

| *pressure 0.001*

for older versions. In both cases, the pressure is set to standard atomspheric pressure (101,325 Pa, equal to 0.001 kilo-atomspheres). Remember to use *restart noscale* to restart the simulation and set the MD time back to zero.

:TIP:
  If you get an error messages stating that bond separations or diameters of angles, dihedrals or inversions exceed the cutoff distance, this may be due to large changes in the system box size. You can use force-capping or variable timestep directives (see above) to control box size changes.

.. _Header_howto_step:

**Choice of MD timestep**

Small timeteps result in slower dynamics but overly large timesteps can lead to system instability. Ideally, the timestep must be small enough to be able to track the fastest motion in the system. Classically, this would involve bonds with the lightest atoms, such as the bonds that contain hydrogen atoms.

:TIP:
   Using the variable timestep directive can provide a clue what is the suitable value for your system: this can be found from the reported timestep in the *CONFIG* file (the fifth value after its title).

If these fastest modes of motion can be removed, then larger timesteps can be used. For molecular systems, typical *timestep* values are shown below:

| All-harmonic bond systems: ~0.5 fs.

| Harmonic bonds but replacing hydrogen-containing bonds with fixed-length constraints: ~2.0 fs

| Systems with core-shell models: ~0.2 fs.
