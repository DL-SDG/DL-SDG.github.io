Welcome to the DL_FIELD reference guide main portal: more illustrations and less wordings than a user manual. If you are new to DL_FIELD or you wish to refresh your memory, you come to the right place. The contents were extracted from DL_FIELD lecture slides given in DL_Software training workshops, but modified for online self-learning experience.
