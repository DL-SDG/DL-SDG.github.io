**The Parameter file (par file)**

These files have filenames in the form of *XX.par*, where *XX* is the FF scheme name. The *par* files are where all the FF parameters are stored. The files contain all types of interactions with the exception of coulombic charges, which are defined for every ATOMs in the MOLECULEs.

All the parameters are enclosed within the appropriate directives according to the type of interactions. For example, for two-body bonding interactions, the parameters are listed within the *BOND* and *END BOND* directives; for three-body angle interactions, the parameters are listed within the *ANGLE* and *END ANGLE* directives, and so forth.

Diagram below shows a portion of bond and dihedral parameters, extracted from the *CHARMM36_lipid.par* file. Words in red were added for illustration purposes.

The *POTENTIAL* directive indicates the FF scheme is of CHARMM36_lipid. The *UNIT* directive shows the energy unit of the parameters, which in this case, is kcal/mol. If users wish to use other energy units in the *dl_poly.FIELD* file, this can be specified in the DL_FIELD *control* file. If needed, DL_FIELD will do automatic unit conversion during the FF model setup processes. 

.. Note::
   The order how the parameters were shown in columns can be different from one FF scheme to the other. This depends on the potential functional forms used, and the way how the parameters were displayed in the original data files.

Lists of available directive that is applicable to the *par* files are shown below:

*BOND*, with *END BOND* |br|
*ANGLE*, with *END ANGLE* |br|
*DIHEDRAL*, with *END DIHEDRAL* |br|
*INVERSION*, with *END INVERSION* |br|
*IMPROPER*, with *END IMPROPER* |br|
*SHELL*, with *END SHELL* |br|
*VDW*, with *END VDW* |br|
*VDW_FIX*, with *END VDW_FIX* |br|
*THREE_BODY*, with *END THREE_BODY* |br|
*EQUIVALENCE*, with *END EQUIVALENCE* |br|
