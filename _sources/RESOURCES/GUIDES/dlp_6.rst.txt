*****************************
Usability with other programs
*****************************

DL_POLY can be used in conjunction with several other programs developed by others to aid in simulation setup, visualise configurations and trajectories, and analyse results. (Note: this is not an exhaustive list!)

Aten
====

`Aten <https://www.projectaten.com/aten>`_ is a free open-source software package that allows editing and manipulationo of atoms and molecules in isolated and periodic systems, either via a graphical user interface (GUI) or command-line scripts. It is designed primarily for creating input coordinates for molecular dynamics packages - including *CONFIG* files for DL_POLY systems - and can use force fields (FFs) to provide energy minimised configurations.

VMD
===

`VMD <http://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ is a free open-source software package for visualising and analysing MD data, capable of rendering single snapshots and generating movies of MD simulations. It includes plug-ins that enable it to read DL_POLY *CONFIG* and *HISTORY* files without any further manipulation.

OVITO
=====

`OVITO <https://www.ovito.org/>`_ is a software package for visualising and analysing MD data, capable of rendering single snapshots and generating movies of MD simulations. Both the free open-source (OVITO Basic) and the commercial (OVITO Pro) versions can read DL_POLY *CONFIG* and *HISTORY* files.

DL_FIELD and DL_ANALYSER
========================

:ref:`DL_FIELD <dl_field_intro>` is a flexible and powerful software package designed to help users set up force field (FF) models for MD simulations with DL_POLY. It can read structures from PDB (Protein Data Bank), xyz and mol2 files and use its extensive library of organic and inorganic FFs to automatically create the required *CONFIG* and *FIELD* files for a DL_POLY simulation.

:ref:`DL_ANALYSER <dl_analyser_intro>` is a general analysis program designed to read DL_POLY files. Beyond It has the ability to identify, quantity and anotate detailed atomistic interactions using the DL_F Notation for the FF system models generated by DL_FIELD.
