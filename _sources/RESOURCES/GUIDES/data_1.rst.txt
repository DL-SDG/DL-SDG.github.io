What is D_ATA
****************

**D_ATA program**

In Chemistry, the non-chemical function and behaviour of all molecular materials are underpinned by the strength and directivity of the constituent inter-atomic interactions. D_ATA is developed to identify these interactions, and from such, to classify, annotate and quantify them to provide statistical and structural information of a molecular systems.

**Functions**

D_ATA (DL Atom Typer and Analyser) is the product combination of two unique features implemented in DL_FIELD and DL_ANALYSER respectively:

(1) DL_F Notation - A standard notation to describe chemical identity of an atom.

(2) DANAI - A language construct based on DL_F Notation to describe localised atomic interactions.

From such, D_ATA

* Identify and classify types of non-bonded interactions.

* Quantify interactions and carry out analysis.

* Calculate order parameters or geometrical analysis for different modes of interactions.

**Capabilities**

* Read user configurations in PDB, xyz and Gromacs gro (configuration) formats. 

* Distinguish interactions that occur either within (intra-) or between (inter-) molecules. 

* Can detect HB and HP interactions.

* Investigate topological interacting structures by measuring linearity and triangular order parameters

* Detect interactions involving atoms from up to two different Chemical Groups.
