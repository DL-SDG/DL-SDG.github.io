**************************
The udff file: 2. Examples 
**************************

In this page, we will be looking at a couple of simple examples how to use a *udff* file.

**Create or modify MOLECULE tempelate**

We intend to override a MOLECULE tempelate in a library file. Suppose you want to change the partial charges for methanol in CHARMM22_prot FF. This can be achieved as follows:

.. image:: ../../image/dl_f_4_3.png
   :scale: 70%
   :align: center

On the left, it shows a portion of the MOLECULE tempelate where the methanol MOLECULE is defined in the library file. On the right, is the same MOLECULE now being redefined in a *udff* file, with changes to the partial charges to the hydroxyl group.

If the similar MOLECULE_TYPE (the name of the MOLECULE) is located in the library, then DL_FIELD will give the following notification in the *dl_field.output* file.

.. literalinclude:: dlf_udff3.txt

and ignore the FF information from the library file.

**Create or modify potential parameter**

Suppose you want to use a more 'up-to-date' set of parameters instead of the those supplied in the library, then the redefinition 


.. image:: ../../image/dl_f_4_2.png
   :scale: 80%
   :align: center

will produce the following notification in the *dl_field.output* file.

.. literalinclude:: dlf_udff3.txt
