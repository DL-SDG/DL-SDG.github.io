**********************
Selective interactions
**********************

By default, DL_FIELD will look for all possible two-body (bond), three-body (angle), and four-body (dihedral) interactions, based on the bond connections. However, DL_FIELD allows a selection of these interactions to be excluded and will not be considered in the DL_POLY simulation runs. 

These optional directives are always defined after the *CONNECT* statements in MOLECULE templates.

**REMOVE, ONLY and OFF directives**

These directives must always be used in conjunction with the body interaction directives: *BOND*, *ANGLE* and *DIHEDRAL*. They are used to selectively include or exclude certain types of interactions. Diagram below illustrates the use of these directives.

Note that each directive takes several parameters depending on types of interactions. For example:   

*BOND REMOVE  label_1   label_2*

*ANGLE ONLY  label_1   label_2   label_3*

Example below shows the use of selective interaction directives in a calcium carbonate MOLECULE template:

.. literalinclude:: molecule.caco3

To completely remove a type of interaction, use the *OFF* directive. For example:

*DIHEDRAL OFF*

Will remove all dihedral terms.

.. Warning:: 
   Avoid conflicting statements such as *ANGLE OFF* and *ANGLE ONLY* directives appeared within a same MOLECULE template.

**Remove 1-4 non-bonded interactions**

An atom pair that is separated by three bonds will usually be treated with vdw and coulombic interactions, called the 1-4 non-bonded interactions, and often scaled with some scaling factors. Such interaction can be switched off selectively within a MOLECULE. The syntax is as follows:

*EXCLUSION_14* label_1 label_2 ...

Each of such statement includes a group of ATOM_LABELs and exclusions will apply if any 1-4 atom pairs are identified within the atom group. Up to a number of 15 ATOMs can be specified in a statement.

.. Note:: 
   More than one *EXCLUSION_14* statements can be defined within a MOLECULE and they are independant from each other. The 1-4 exclusions only apply to the respective group of atoms defined in each statement.
