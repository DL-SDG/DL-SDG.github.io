Structures and operations
*************************

This page illustrates the software structural aspects and provide brief summary how it works.

D_ATA is operated via several input files and control options without any scripting capability.

**File structures**

Diagram below shows a flowchart of the Program operations.

D_ATA package comes with the following input file components:

* INPUT_FILE that comes with the default filename *d_ata.input*. This is where user's configurations are defined. 


* CONTROL_FILE that comes with the default filename *d_ata.control*. This is where options are selected to produce the desired results. |br| 

Most users will access the above mentioned files when running D_ATA. Files below are located in the *lib/* folder. Do not change or delete these files unless you know what you are doing.
|br| 

* DLF_notation library file, which indicates Chemical Groups that are reconisable by D_ATA, together with the unique index reference to each Chemical Groups.

* DLF_map, an interaction mapping reference. D_ATA uses the information to decide types of interaction presents in the system.

In addition, a path entry file, *d_ata_path*, must always locate at the D_ATA home directory. This special file specifies the directory paths and names of various file components.

**Operations**

If you wish to have a quick taste how D_ATA operates, go to this page - :doc:`../d_ata_howto`. 

In summary: it is very easy to run D_ATA. Just insert input configuration files in INPUT_FILE and then run D_ATA. In most cases, options in the CONTROL_FILE  do not need frequent change.

**Program execution**

Steps below show what happens when D_ATA is run:

(1) Read *dl_a_path*.

(2) Read CONTROL_FILE.

(3) Read configuration (input) file, located in the INPUT_FILE.

(4) Determine and annotate atoms in DL_F Notation (atom typing).

(5) Write out atom types in *d_ata.csf*, a *chemical structure file*. 

If options to carry out atomic interaction analysis:

(6) Identify non-bonded interactions, classify according to chemical bahaviour of atoms.

(7) Results analysis in terms of various modes of atomic interactions.
