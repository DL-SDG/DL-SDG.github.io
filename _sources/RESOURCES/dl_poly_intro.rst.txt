DL_POLY is a general-purpose, classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulation software.

**Functions**

1. Molecular dynamics of polyatomic systems - almost any kinds of molecular systems, from biological to solid states, including mixed component bio-inorganics.

2. Optimisation by conjugate gradient of zero K annealing.

3. On-the-fly calculation of common thermodynamic properties.

4. Domain decomposition parallisation strategy allowing simulation of model sizes that are limited to computer memories.

5. Self-contained, free-formatted Fortran90+MPI2 code, can run in most computer platforms - single-processor PC to multi-processor supercomputers.
