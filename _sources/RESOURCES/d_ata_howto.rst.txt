This page tells you how to set D_ATA up and running.  

**How to obtain D_ATA**

* `D_ATA web site <https://www.ccp5.ac.uk/D_ATA>`_ â€“ Atomic interaction analysis tool. Click on REGISTRATION button.

* D_ATA User Manual (:download:`PDF<./DOCUMENTS/MAN_D_ATA_1.0.pdf>`) - Version 1.0, November 2024.

* :doc:`TUTORIALS/data_0` - Online learning site, useful for new users.

To be able to use D_ATA you first need to register `here <https://www.ccp5.ac.uk/d_ata-registration>`_. Successful registration will lead to you receiving a .tar.gz file (e.g. d_ata_1.0.tar.gz). Unpack or untar this for example in Linux::

  $: tar -xzvf d_ata_1.0.tar.gz

.. Note::
   The number 1.0 refers to the software version, which can be different if a newer version is released.

This will produce a directory **d_ata_1.0** which contains a *d_ata.control* (D_ATA control file), *d_ata_path* and a **README.md** file (amongst other files). You then need to compile to produce the executable *d_ata* as follows :: 

  $: cd d_ata_1.0
  $: cd source
  $: make

This will create the *d_ata* executable file in the D_ATA home directory.

**General guidance for running D_ATA**

The *d_ata_path* is called the path entry file and must always locate in the D_ATA home directory where *d_ata* executable file is located. 

The path entry file contains information about the locations for various file components that are needed when running D_ATA program.

.. Note::
   File names and their locations are set to defaults. They can be changed according to your needs. 

Inspect *d_ata.input* and *d_ata.control* files. You will notice an *example1.xyz* structure has already been included (from *example/* folder) with the necessary control options being set in the *d_ata.control* file. This example is an ethanoic acid liquid systems consist of several trajectory frames derived from a molecular dynamics simulations.

To run D_ATA program, just type ::
   
   $: ./d_ata

The program will then read the example structure, one frame at a time, and reports on screen about the types of interactions detected. 

Once the run is completed, inspect the results output files produced in the *output/* folder. The type and number of results files depend on the input structure. In this example, there are five different output files.

(1) Standard status output file, *d_ata.output*

(2) The chemical structure file (csf), d_ata.csf, that shows atoms' chemical identities.

(3) The general results output file, *d_ata.results*.

(4) Count profile for a number of different modes of interactions with respect to MD time. (*count_XX_XX_XX.results*).
