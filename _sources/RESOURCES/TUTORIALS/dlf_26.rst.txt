*****************************
Force field files for Gromacs
*****************************

This feature is only available for version 4.11 onwards.

This page describes how to use DL_FIELD to produce FF files for Gromacs simulation package. It does not describe Gromacs file structure
and directives in details. For more information, please consult Gromacs manual. 

For more information about Gromacs output in DL_FIELD, consult the manual, Chapter 14.

**Option to produce Gromacs files**

By default, DL_FIELD will always produce FF files for DL_POLY. To produce FF files for Gromacs as well,
the keyword *gromacs* must be used in the DL_FIELD *control* file as follows:

.. literalinclude:: dl_field.control.gromacs
   :emphasize-lines: 3,19,22  

If the option to run Gromacs program is also switched on, then after FF files are produced, DL_FIELD will setup a binary *tpr*
file and run a single-point calculation on Gromacs (provided the program is also available in the same machine where DL_FIELD 
is executed).

**Output files**

Upon successful FF conversions, DL_FIELD will produce the following files:

(1) The system topology file, *gromacs.top*.

(2) One or more include topology files, *gromacsX.itp*, wwhere *X* = 1, 2, 3, ...

(3) A coordinate file, *gromacs.gro*.

(4) A generic MD parameter file, *gromacs.mdp*.

DL_FIELD can produce several *itp* files, which correspond to the number of Molecular Groups defined in the 
configuration file. 

Each *itp* file contains force field information for each Molecular Group. These *itp* files 
are included in the top file, which defines the ATOM_TYPEs and provides a summary of system composition.
