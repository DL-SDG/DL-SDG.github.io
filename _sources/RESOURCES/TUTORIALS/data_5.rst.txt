Chemical Structure File (csf)
*****************************

The csf is a file that defines the chemical identity in DL_F Notation for every atom identified in the system. Each time when D_ATA is run, a csf will be generated, called *d_ata.csf*.

Below shows a section of csf generated for a drug molecule called firocoxib, an anti-inflammatory drug for animals.

The csf file contains the full information about the chemical and topological states of molecular systems. However,
at the moment, D_ATA does not use csf file apart from just showing the chemical information for every atom in the system.

.. Note::
   If the Program Mode option is set to 2, then only one csf file will be generated (*d_ata.csf*). If Program Mode is set to 1, then a number of csf files (*d_ata_X.csf*) will be generated, one for each input configuration file defined in the INPUT_FILE.
