**********************************
Pentanoic acid liquid (input) 
**********************************

This section illustrates the use of D_ATA to determine interactions that occur in a molecular system consists of pentanoic acid liquid.
The model trajectories were obtained from a standard NPT molecular simulation at 300 K and 1 atm. pressure.

**Step 1 - Obtain atomic trajectories**

Simulation was carried out using DL_POLY and atomic trajectories were converted from HISTORY file to *xyz* by using DL_ANALYSER (or any other utility script to do the same job). This *xyz* file would be used as the input coinfiguration for D_ATAS program (see below).

**Step 2 - Insert the xyz filename into INPUT_FILE (d_ata.input)**

**Step 3 - CONTROL_FILE (d_ata.control)**

Below shows options that are selected for this analysis.
