***************
Adding solvents
***************

The DL_FIELD *control* file also contain a feature where you can solvate your system. This is done once the FF model for the input structure has been setup. If the Solution Maker feature is activated, then the system will only be solvated after molecules have been duplicated. In DL_FIELD, before solvation, the molecular system is collectively considered to consist of solute molecules.

The necessary input parameters are as follows:

*solvent_key* |sp| |sp| *cutoff*

where *solvent_key* is the name of the molecule that will fill the system. The *cutoff* value is the minimum permitted distance between a solvent molecule and a solute molecule. The solvent molecule will be rejected if the distance is smaller than the *cutoff* value. 

For example:

*meoh* |sp| |sp| *2.0*

Means solvate the system with methanol with a cutoff distance of 2.0 Angstrom.

.. Note::
   Solvation feature only works if simulation box size is specified and must be either cubic or orthrhombic shapes. In addition, DL_FIELD can only solvate systems of sizes that are at least 20 Angstrom at all x, y, and z directions.

**Solvent templates**

DL_FIELD uses solvent templates to solvate the system. These templates are located in the *solvent/* directory. Each template consists of a box of pre-equilibrated solvent molecules at the standard density at 300 K. The template size is 20 x 20 x 20 Angstrom :sup:`3`.

To find out what solvent templates are available, look into the file called *solvent_list* in the *solvent/* directory. Under the Solvent list tile, the following information is displayed:

*solvent_key* - description - *filename*

Below shows a portion of the solvent list:

.. literalinclude:: solvent_list.txt 

The most relevant information to the users are *solvent_keys*. For example, to use original TIP3P water model, insert the key TIP3P_O in the *control* file. To use methanol as solvent, insert the key MeOH in the *control* file. Note that the *solvent_keys* are case insensitive.
