*******************
The DL_F Notation 2
*******************

This page briefly describes DL_F Notation features, the notation syntax and shows some examples. For more details please consult the manual and the reference.

**Features**

The DL_F Notation general formats are as follows:

The ATOM_TYPEs are determined via molecular topology analysis. The ATOM_TYPEs are listed in a file called the *dlf_notation.output* in the *output/* directory. 

There is no need to keep track of the ATOM_KEYs in the library files. The ATOM_KEYs can be generated *in-situ* in DL_FIELD, based on the ATOM_TYPEs. 

The optional tokens are some alphabets and symbols that indicate the types and positions of atoms within a *CG*. For instance, the ethanol molecule in the previous page contained the tokens *p* and *s*, which refers to *primary* and *secondary* carbon atoms, respectively.

Other more common tokens are *E* and *L*, which refer to *end* and *linked* position, respectively.

The latest DL_FIELD version (4.7) can detect about four hundred *CGs*. More will be added when new versions are released.

In summary, DL_F Notation has the following features:

- Expression of standard atom types with a consistent format for a range of FF schemes.

- Use of the universal atom typing procedures within DL_FIELD.

- Produce DL_POLY files with consistent ATOM_KEYs for more precise and ease of results analysis.

- Easy to identify, with sensible format of naming atoms that indicates precisely its chemical nature.

- Use of xyz input configuration file format with full automatic determination of ATOM_TYPEs.

**Example structures**

(1) A pyridine molecule. The tokens *-1*, *-2*, etc, are the numering sequence that is usually used in aromatic ring systems.

(2) Assignments of ATOM_TYPEs in DL_F Notation and PCFF force field for favipiravir molecule, an antivirial medication.

(3) Illustration of using xyz as the input structure in DL_FIELD, to produce the ATOM_TYPEs. Then, the corresponding *FIELD* file was produced, with the atom labels showed in the standard OPLS FF notation.

(4) Another similar example to the one above but the *FIELD* file shows the atom labels expressed in the standard notation for PCFF force field.
