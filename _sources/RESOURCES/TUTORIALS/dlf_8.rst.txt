***********
Atom Typing
***********

The |pop1| is a procedure to decide the ATOM_TYPEs of every atoms in the system. Eact ATOM_TYPE is referenced to a specific ATOM_KEY, and from such, to assign the appropriate FF parameters.

Different FF schemes use different rules to determine the ATOM_TYPEs. For this reason, converting one FF model to the other FF models is often a non-trivial task. 

DL_FIELD uses the following approaches to obtain ATOM_TYPEs:

(1) Template matching (for PDB files).

(2) Molecular topology analysis using the DL_F Notation (for xyz, mol2 files).

(3) Combination of both (for xyz).

**Template Matching**

This atom typing procedure involves matching of molecular system against pre-defined MOLECULE templates in the *sf* files or the *udff* file if available. DL_FIELD will give an error if no suitable template is found.

Once a MOLECULE is identified, ATOM_TYPEs are assigned according to the connectivity information and the atoms are rearranged according to the template assignment.

In summary, template matching has the following characteristics:

- A MOLECULE template must be explicitly pre-defined, indicating the ATOMs and the corresponding ATOM_TYPEs and charges.

- Possible to use auto-CONNECT feature to simplify the template definition. Useful for complex MOLECULEs.

- Can fine tune model behaviour - introduce constrains, rigid body, core-shell and pseudo-points.

- Useful for specific classes of molecules - proteins (amino acid residues), DNA and carbohydrates.

- Suitable for user's structures in PDB, with a correct |pop2|.

The disadvantage of using template matching procedure is that the MOLECULE template construction can be tedious and the ATOM_TYPEs must be pre-assigned by the users.

Diagram above illustrates the FF conversion of ethyl acetate (ethyl ethanoate) for Amber GAFF force field. In the PDB file, the MOLECULE_KEY ETAC must be inserted in the PDB file. DL_FIELD will base on this information to look for the corresponding MOLECULE template to produce the DL_POLY FF files.

**Molecular topology analysis**

Carry out detailed molecular topology analysis. From such, DL_FIELD can determine the chemical nature of every atom in the system that naturally expresses by the ATOM_TYPEs, by making use of the DL_F Notation (see next page).  

In summary, the topology analysis approach has the following characteristics:

- Do not need to create MOLECULE template.

- Do not need to decide ATOM_TYPEs. This is done automatically by DL_FIELD (auto atom typing).

- Limited fine-tuning options. For example, only allow constrains on H-containing bonds.

- Applicable to OPLS2005, PCFF and CVFF only.

**Combination of both procedures**

Some FF schemes require the use of templates to setup FF models. CHARMM and AMBER are two of such examples and they are called the template-based FF. Normally, PDB files would be needed. However, DL_FIELD allows the use of xyz file, provided the MOLECULE templates are available, either in the *.sf* file or the udff file.

In the case, DL_FIELD will automatically identify the molecules in the system and search for a suitable template to match with the molecules. Once a template is found, it will carry out the template matching procedure as mentioned above. 

In summary, combined procedure has the following characteristics:

- Applicable to CHARMM, AMBER and some OPLS-type FF such as CL&P and DES.
  
- Need pre-defined MOLECULE templates, that consists of individual small molecules.

- Does not apply to complex structures such as proteins, DNA, polysachharides, etc.
