********************************
Gromacs setting and restrictions
********************************

Gromacs contains numerous directives and different ways to achieve same FF definitions.
In addition, not all the features implemented in DL_FIELD is applicable to Gromacs.

This page describes some default rules and restrictions when setting up FF files for Gromacs.

**Default settings**

DL_FIELD adopts the following default rules:

(1) The *nrexcl* parameter is always set to 3. This means non-bonded interactions (vdw and Coulombic) on the 1-2, 1-3 and 1-4 atom pairs will be excluded by default.

(2) The *gen-pair* parameter is always set to *no*. This instructs Gromacs **not to** automatically generate 1-4 atom pairs for non-bonded interactions.

(3) The fudge QQ (1-4 Coulombic scaling factor) and fudge LJ (1-4 vdw scaling factor) defined in the [ defaults ] Gromacs directive will be set to the chosen FF scheme. These scaling factors are only shown as a reference. For a multiple-potential setting, they are set to a default value of 1.0. In both cases, they are most probably not going to be used because the correct scaling factors are defined in the [ pair ] directive (see below).

(4) All 1-4 interactions, their scalings or specific potential parameters, will be explicitly defined under the [ pair ] Gromacs directive. If require, this is where any additional non-bonded interactions that has been excluded due to the *nrexcl* value will be defined.

(5) All other non-bonded interactions (1-5 and beyond) will be mixed according to the combination rule set in the [ default ] directive. The vdw parameters and charges for these calculations will be extracted from the [ atomtypes ] and [ atoms ] Gromacs directives, respectively.

**Restrictions**

(1) At the moment, conversion to Gromacs files only works for input configurations expressed in PDB and *xyz* formats only.

(2) Irrespective of what energy unit is specified in DL_FIELD *control* file, all energy unit will be converted to kJ/mol and nm for the unit distance in the Gromacs files.

(3) FF conversions only work for FF schemes that use LJ 12-6 and Buckingham potentials. For example, PCFF that uses LJ 9-6 form would not work. In addition, Buckingham potentials only work for older version Gromacs (before 2019 versions).

(4) Gromacs imposes a fix-format on the *gromacs.gro* coordinate files. For instance, the atom labels can only display up to five-character in length and the coordinates are specified to three decimals. An error can occur when running Gromacs if the data format is violated.However, DL_FIELD will not check for this.

(5) Because of point (3), comparison of single-point energies between DL_POLY and Gromacs are likely to be different due to differing scaling precisions and distance units being used.

(6) DL_FIELD does not include CMAP energy correction for the φ/ψ backbone dihedral angles. Therefore, it is not recommended to use DL_FIELD to setup protein force fields such as CHARMM that use CMAP for molecular simulations.

(7) For multiple-potential models, only systems based on Lennard-Jones 12-6 functions can be successfully setup. Gromacs does not support mixed-function setting. For example, a model consists of both Lennard-Jones and Buckingham potentials for the vdw interactions. DL_FIELD can still produce Gromacs files for such systems, although grompp will generate an error when trying to produce a *tpr* file.

(8) The rigid body or the [RIGID] directive in DL_FIELD, is not supported for Gromacs. The exception would be for the water models. In this case, the Gromacs directive command [ settles ] will be used.

For more details about the restrictions, please consult Chapter 14.3 of DL_FIELD manual.
