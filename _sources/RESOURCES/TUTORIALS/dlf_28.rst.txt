**Conversion of organic molecules**

Consider a molecular system consists of phenylalanine enclosed in a :math:`\beta`\-cyclodextrin (structure shown below) and solvates the whole system with ethanol in a cubic box of size 80 Ã…. All H-containing bonds are also constrained.

   :scale: 40%
   :align: center

The corresponding confirguration file (in *xyz* format) is shown below. The molecular system is separated into two Molecular Groups: CYC refers the cyclodextrin cage and PHE for the organic molecule enclosed within the cage.

.. literalinclude:: cyc_phe.xyz 
   :emphasize-lines: 3,19

To carry out this conversion, below highlights the relevant options in a DL_FIELD *control* file.

.. literalinclude:: dl_field.control.cyc_phe 
   :emphasize-lines: 3,4,11,16,19,20,21,22,27,33,34

After conversion, DL_FIELD will produce three *itp* files, one for each Molecular Group: one for CYC, one for PHE and the other for ethanol solvent (ETOH). They are all included in the *gromacs.top* as follows:

.. literalinclude:: gromacs.top

The file shows an additional 5212 ethanol molecules have been added as solvent in the system.
