******************
The *control* file
******************

This page briefly describes the features of DL_ANALYSER *control* file. It is the master control file where you can decide how analysis can be carried out. 

The control file is the main interaction point for users to specify what and how to analyse the configuration files specified in the *input* file.

By default, the *control* file is named as *dl_analyser.control* located in the *workspace/* folder.

:TIP:
   You can change the *control* filename or even create different *control* files for different needs. Make sure the *dl_a_path* is appropriately set to ensure correct *control* file is used.

Below shows the content summary of a typical *control* file

.. literalinclude:: dl_analyser.control

All available analysis options are listed in the file and relevant analysis types are grouped into different *Sections*.
For example, the *Dynamic Analysis Section*, *Structural Analysis Section*, *Trajectory Production Section*, etc.

**Analysis Options**

All analysis options take some forms of input parameters. The general characteristics of analysis options are as follows:

(1) Each analysis option is provided with a brief descriptions including the available choices of parameters.

(2) All analysis options include a switch which can be either off (0) or on (1). Some options require additional parameters to carry out the analysis, which can straddle across two lines.

(3) All analysis will be carried out according to the conditions set in the *Atom Range Definition Section*.

**Analysis Sections**

General characteristics of *Sections*:

(1) Each *Section* comes with a master switch. If this swtich is turned off (0), then the whole *Section* will be deactivated.

(2) Each *Section* comes with its own output file to which the analysis results are written out. 

(3) The *Trajectory Production Section* is a stand-alone *Section* that do not interact with the rest of the *Sections*.

(4) All analysis *Sections* carry out analysis according to the conditions set in the *Atom Range Definition Section*.


.. Warning::
   No check will be made if more than two *Sections* use the same output file. Be sure to use different output filenames for each *Section*.

.. Warning:: 
   Please do not just turn on every analysis options. Depending on the systems, DL_ANALYSER can produce an error or non-sensical results. Think what you want to get out and switch on (and off) the options accordingly.
