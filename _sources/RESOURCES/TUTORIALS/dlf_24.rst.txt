********************
The *dl_f_path* file 
********************

When DL_FIELD is run, the *dl_f_path* file is the first file to read. It contains information about the directory paths of various file components. Each file precedes with a *COMPONENT FILE TYPE* and an equal '=' sign. These are shown as follows:

*LIBRARY* = directory location to force field library files.

*SOLVENT* = directory location to solvent templates. This *COMPONENT* is only relevant if solvation feature is used.

*OUTPUT* = directory location where the output files are written out. Example output files are the converted FF model files such as *dlpoly.CONFIG*, *dlpoly.FIELD* and *dlf_notation.output*.

*CONTROL* = location and filename of the DL_FIELD *control* file.

*CHARMM_RTF* = location and filename for CHARMM's residue topology file (rtf). DL_FIELD reads this file and converts it to the equivalent *udff* file to setup force field models.

*CHARMM_PRM* = location and filename for CHARMM's parameter file (prm). DL_FIELD reads this file and converts it to the equivalent *udff* file to setup force field models.

*CHARMM_PSF* = location and filename of CHARMM's protein structure file (psf). DL_FIELD reads this file and converts it to the equivalent *udff* file to setup force field models.

*CHARMM_PDB* = location and filename of a PDB file that is produced along with a matching psf file using CHARMM's *psfgen*.

The remark statement is indicated with the '#' symbol at the first column of the line and the rest of the information will be ignored by DL_FIELD. Below shows an example of *dl_f_path* file. 


.. literalinclude:: dl_f_path.txt

The *dl_f_path* must be located in the DL_FIELD home directory, which is where DL_FIELD program is run. The directory paths can be either absolute or relative (to DL_FIELD home directory) type.
