*******************
What is DL_ANALYSER
*******************

**DL_ANALYSER program**

The DL_ANALYSER project was initiated by Chin Yong to facilitate DL_POLY users to carry out post analysis work on the HISTORY trajectory files produced by DL_POLY simulation runs.  At the time of this writing, the latest version 2.3 was released in September 2021.

DL_ANALYSER can generate results for a variety of system models: from condensed matters to surface slabs. It has a range analysis criteria that enable users to selectively carry out the analysis on the system models.

The Program's development concept and file structures are similar to that of DL_FIELD and therefore both software can work in a synchronous way.

**Capabilities**

* Reads DL_POLY's HISTORY, CONFIG and STATIS files; xyz and PDB files.  

* Conversion of HISTORY file to PDB and xyz trajectory files.

* Detailed model selection to carry out specific analysis - atom or molecule based, within (intra) or between (inter) molecules, and atom range selections.

* Group-based analysis.

* Analysis modules for a range of systems.

* **Atomic interaction analysis** - Quantify, annotate and carry out a range of analysis on atomic interactions (require DL_FIELD for FF model setup in the DL_F Notation). 

Features appear in bold are unique to DL_FIELD.

**Analysis Modules**

For ease of selection, analysis options are classified into different *Sections*. Some Sections are specific to certain kind system models. 

* Trajectory Production Section

* Atom Range Definition Section

* Structural Analysis Section (general)

* Dynamical Analysis Section (general)

* Defect Analysis Section (surface and crystals bulk)

* Sputter Analysis Section (surface models)

* Biological Analysis Section (protein models)

* Atomic Interaction Analysis Section (general)
