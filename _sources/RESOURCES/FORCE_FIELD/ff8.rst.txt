Non-bonded functions
********************

While the bonded components mainly resposible to model the molecular structures, the inter-molecular functions are mainly responsible to model the overall behaviour of the system model such as densities, molar volumes, heats of vapourisation, etc.

Non-bonded functions are mainly composed of two components: the short-ranged van der Waals (vdw) interactions and the long-ranged electrostatic interactions. These energy components are calculated based on interactions between pairs of atoms and the functions depend only on the interatomic distance.

.. Note:: 
   For atoms within a molecule, non-bonded interactions will apply on the 1-4 atoms (atom pairs that are seprated by three successive bonds) onwards.

**Electrostatic interactions**

The Coulombic functions are usually used.

As will see later in the page relates to cutoff distances, special methods would be needed to more accurately to sum them up.

**van der Waals interactions**

There are many types of functional forms, the commonest are as follows:

As you can see, the functions consist of two components: positive terms that describe the electron repulsion due to the Pauli exclusion principle and negative dispersive terms due to electron cloud fluctuations.
