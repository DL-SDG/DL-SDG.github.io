Lennard-Jones Mixing Rules 
**************************

The vdw parameters are normally fitted against the experimental results such as the liquid densities and enthalpy of vaporisation of pure components. It is also a standard practice to obtain parameters of similar type of atoms, of *i* = *j* as we have seen in the previous page for the methyl carbon atoms.

However, molecular systems can consist of different types of atoms (where *i* :math:`\neq` *j*) and each different combination pairs of atom types would have a different set of parameters that are often too many to fit them all.

These missing vdw parameters are usually derived by using some kind of *mixing rules* involving parameters for those of atomic components (*ii* and *jj*) that made up the atom pairs (*ij*).  

Diagram below shows some of the mixing rules for LJ 12-6 functions:

Out of these rules, the geometric and arithmatic rules are being used the most frequently by a wide range of force field schemes. However, the rules differ from one scheme to the other. For example, OPLS uses geometric rule to determine both the :math:`\epsilon` and :math:`\sigma` for *ij* pairs. Whereas, for DREIDING FF, the arithmatic rule is used for the :math:`\sigma` and geometric for the :math:`\epsilon`.

.. Note::
   Mixing rules have minimal scientific justification but appear to work 'quite well'. Also, the mixing rules should only apply to the same function type. For example, you cannot mix parameters between LJ and Buckingham functions. Neither should you mix parameters from LJ 12-6 and, say, LJ 9-6.
