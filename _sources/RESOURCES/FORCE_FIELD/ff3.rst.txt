Bonded interactions
*******************

Intra-molecular or bonded interactions consist of energy components that are short-range in nature and usually applied within a molecule to maintain its geometrical structure.

Bonded interactions consist of several energy components as follows:

* **Bond interaction**. Also called a 1-2 interaction. It describes interactions between two bonded atoms.

* **Angle interaction**. Also called a 1-3 interaction. It describes interactions between two atoms that are bonded to a common atom. 

* **Dihedral (torsional) interaction**. Also called a 1-4 interaction. It describes the angular interaction drawn between planes 1,2,3 and 2,3,4. 

The diagram below shows a summary of these interactions.

* **Improper interaction**. This is a type of dihedral interaction that is imposed on certain molecular functional groups to preserve a particular geometry for three atoms around a central atom. Examples of these functional groups are carbonates and carbonyls, where the improper interaction is used to maintain a planar conformation (i.e. :math:`\alpha = 0^{\circ}`).

The diagram below illustrates how these interactions are applied to a molecular structure (salicylic acid).

So far, we have discussed *directly* bonded interactions. Depending on the type of FF, other types of *cross-component* bonded interactions can exist. For instance, *bond-bond* interactions, where cross-component interactions are described in terms of distances between two successive bonds (1-2 and 2-3). Other cross-components may also involve more extensive geometries such as *angle-angle*, *bond-angle* and even *angle-torsion* interactions.
