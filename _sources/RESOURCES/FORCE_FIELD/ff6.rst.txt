Model approximation
*******************

Note that these potential functions only *approximately* represent molecular structures. 

For example, bond vibrations are commonly represented as a simple harmonic with a force constant and bond equilibrium length that represent the characteristics of the bond. Such a representation is not realistic because it renders the bond as unbreakable, as shown in the diagram below.

Note that the harmonic function is only a close fit around the equilibrium distance :math:`b_0`. This approximation is usually applicable close to room temperature (298 K) and might not be appropriate for higher temperatures.

Alternatively, a Morse function, which provides a better fit to reality, can be used. It is a better approximation for the vibrational structure of the molecule that accounts for the anharmonicity of a real bond.

The Morse function would need fitting to three parameters:

* :math:`D_e`, the well depth, which measures the bond strength
* :math:`\alpha`, which is associated with the width of the potential
* :math:`b_0`, the equilibrium bond length

The quantity :math:`\alpha` is related to the (harmonic) force constant, :math:`k_b`, at the minimum well depth:

.. math::
   \alpha = \sqrt{\frac{k_b}{2 D_e}}
