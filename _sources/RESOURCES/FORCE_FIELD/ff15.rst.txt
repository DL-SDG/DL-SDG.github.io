1-4 interaction scaling Factors   
*******************************

As mentioned earlier, the non-bonded interactions apply to all pairs of unconnected atoms between molecules. For atoms within molecules, the non-bonded interactions apply to pairs of atoms that are at least three consecutive bonds apart (1-4 interactions).

However, due to the inadequacy of classical force fields, the fitted vdW interactions and Coulombic interactions can be over-estimated at the 1-4 sites. To minimise these effects, scaling factors can be included to reduce the over-exaggeration of short-range repulsive effects and give better conformational energies for the molecules. 

These scaling factors, called the *1-4 vdW scaling factor* (:math:`f_{vdW}`) and the *1-4 electrostatic scaling factor* (:math:`f_{e}`) are often included as some constants for the non-bonded interactions between the pairs of 1-4 atoms. The actual derivation of these scaling factors is quite arbitrary and can vary from one FF scheme to another.

The diagram above illustrates an application of scaling factors on the 1-4 atom pair but not on the atom pair separated by four consecutive bonds (the 1-5 atom pair).

.. Note::
   The 1-4 scaling factors only apply to molecules with covalent bonds. They are not involved in ionic structures, which mainly interact via electrostatic (Coulombic) interactions.     

The values of scaling factors can be different for different force field schemes. For example, OPLS FF uses a scaling factor of 0.5 for both :math:`f_{vdW}` and :math:`f_{e}`.  

For general AMBER FF, :math:`f_{vdW} = 0.5` and :math:`f_{e} = 1/1.2`. However, AMBER FF for carbohydrates, such as Glycam, would set :math:`f_{vdW} = f_{e} = 1.0` by default. 

Some FF schemes such as CHARMM set these scaling factors to 1.0 (i.e. no scaling factors are applied to 1-4 atom pairs). Instead, sets of different vdW parameters are used specifically for vdW interactions at the 1-4 atom sites.

.. Note::
   DL_FIELD will automatically set the correct 1-4 scalings depend on the choice of FF scheme. These scaling factors are listed under the *dihedral* directive in DL_POLY *FIELD* files.
