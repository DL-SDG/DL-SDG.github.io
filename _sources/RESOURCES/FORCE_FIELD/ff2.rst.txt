Force Fields (FF)
*****************

A system potential often contains (usually implicitly) a number of physical approximations â€“ they are related to models of system behaviour. Force fields can be generic to a class of molecules or specific for a material.

The FF is modelled classically as some mathematical description of the energies and forces between atoms in terms of atomic positions:

.. math::
   FF = pot_1 + pot_2 + \cdots + pot_n

Where :math:`pot` is a mathematical function (or potential function) of an energy component. Each function also contains some constants, or potential *parameters*, that are adjusted such that the potential functions approximately represent the chemical behaviour of the interacting components.

The first derivative of these functions give the forces applied on each atom: from such, the velocities and positions of the atom are derived.
