DL_POLY
*******************************
* `DL_POLY <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY.aspx>`_ – molecular dynamics simulations (version 4.09 and above).

To be able to use the latest version of DL_POLY you first need to `register here <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY-Registration.aspx>`_. Successful registration will lead to you receiving an email containing instructions on how to download the latest version of DL_POLY. Following the instructions in the email from CCP5-ADMIN should give you an unzipped directory (e.g. **dl_poly_4.09**).
The next step is to compile a dl_poly executable. If you want to compile an executable that runs on more than one core i.e. an mpi version to run on a high performance computing (HPC) system, first transfer the dl_poly directory to the HPC and type the commands below (example given for a bash terminal) adapting if necessary for specific HPC::
  
  $: cd dl_poly_4.09
  $: mkdir build-mpi
  $: cd build-mpi
  $: module load cmake gcc7 openmpi-gcc7
  $: FFLAGS="-O3" FC=gfortran cmake ../
  $: make –j8    (where 8 is the number of processes used to compile the executable)

Succesful compilation leads to the creation of the dl_poly executable (**DLPOLY.Z**), which can be found in **dl_poly_4.09/build-mpi/bin/**.

:TIP:
   Copy the executable *DLPOLY.Z* to the directory from where you will run simulations e.g.::

     $ cd DL_POLY_SIMULATION
     $ cp dl_poly_4.09/build-mpi/bin/DLPOLY.Z .

.. Note::

   The exact name of the DL_POLY directory will depend on the version you have downloaded. At the time of writing this, the latest version was dl_poly_4.09.

**Continuation runs of simulations**

When you need to re-run a simulation make a 'copy script' using a text editor that can be used to quickly copy the CONFIG, REVCON and REVIVE files as shown below (in the same order)::

     $: emacs copy.sh  # this creates a new script file using the emacs text editor

.. literalinclude:: dlpoly_script.sh 

Then ensure the script is executable::
  
    $: chmod +x dlpoly_script.sh

and to run it::
  
    $: ./copy.sh
