This page tells you how to set DL_POLY up and running.

**How to obtain DL_POLY**

* `DL_POLY <https://gitlab.com/ccp5/dl-poly>`_ â€“ molecular dynamics simulations (version 5.0.0 and above).

* DL_POLY User Manual (:download:`PDF<./DOCUMENTS/MAN_DL_POLY_5.0.0.pdf>`) - Version 5.0.0, February 2021.

To be able to use the latest version of DL_POLY you first need to clone its `GitLab repository <https://gitlab.com/ccp5/dl-poly>`_ using one of the following commands::

  $: git clone git@gitlab.com:ccp5/dl-poly.git
  $: git clone https://gitlab.com/ccp5/dl-poly.git

or use the 'Code' button in the above-linked webpage to download the current version of its source code as a zipped folder (in .zip, .tar.gz or similar formats) and unpack it. We also strongly recommend `registering here <https://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_POLY/>`_, so you can gain access to mailing lists for DL_POLY and CCP5.

Building DL_POLY requires cmake and a Fortran compiler, and ideally an implementation of MPI to run DL_POLY on more than one core, e.g. if you want to run DL_POLY on a high performance computing (HPC) platform. Full details are available `here <https://gitlab.com/ccp5/dl-poly/-/blob/devel/building.rst>`_, but to summarise - load in these (or similar) modules if required::

  $: module load cmake gcc7 openmpi-gcc7

and then invoke the following commands to build, compile and install DL_POLY::

  $: cmake -S dl-poly -Bbuild-mpi-pure -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
  $: cmake --build build-mpi-pure
  $: cmake --install build-mpi-pure

If you do not have access to MPI, you can build a serial (one-core) version of DL_POLY with the following::

  $: cmake -S dl-poly -Bbuild-serial -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DWITH_MPI=OFF
  $: cmake --build build-serial
  $: cmake --install build-serial

Succesful compilation leads to the creation of the dl_poly executable (**DLPOLY.Z**), which can be found in **dl-poly/build-mpi/bin/** (or **dl-poly/build-serial/bin/**).

:TIP:
   Copy the executable *DLPOLY.Z* to the directory from where you will run simulations e.g.::

     $ cd DL_POLY_SIMULATION
     $ cp dl-poly/build-mpi/bin/DLPOLY.Z .

**Continuation runs of simulations**

When you need to re-run a simulation, make a 'copy script' using a text editor that can be used to quickly copy the CONFIG, REVCON and REVIVE files as shown below (in the same order)::

     $: emacs copy.sh  # this creates a new script file using the emacs text editor (substitute 'emacs' with your favourite editor)

.. literalinclude:: dlpoly_script.sh 

Then ensure the script is executable::
  
    $: chmod +x dlpoly_script.sh

and to run it::
  
    $: ./copy.sh
