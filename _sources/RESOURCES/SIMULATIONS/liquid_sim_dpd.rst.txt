.. This describes the simulation of a liquid using DPD


***************************************
Simulating a liquid using DPD (DL_MESO)
***************************************

This is an exercise in simulating a box of liquid at the mesoscale using Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD). The liquid can be represented in DPD simulations in one of two forms:

#. Individual particles (beads), each containing at least one (small) molecule; or
#. Chains of particles connected by bonds, each chain representing one (larger) molecule and providing its basic topology.

This exercise goes from preparing the input files with the required representation of the fluid, its interactions and system set-up parameters, to running a DPD simulation using DL_MESO and analysing the results.
