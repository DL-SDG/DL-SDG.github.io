**Example 1**: Ionic liquid droplets interaction with silicon surface 

Reference: Y. Guan, Q. Shao, W. Chen, S. Liu, X. Zhang, and Y. Deng, *J. Phys. Chem. C* **121** 23716–23726 (2017)

Simulation box size: 80 Å × 160 Å × 130 Å 

Silicon surface: Held rigid (frozen), with a lattice constant (5.46 Å): 76.8 × 153.6 × 5.76 Å (3000 atoms). Arranged with the surface plane orthogonal to the z-direction of the simulation box.

Ionic liquid: Initial structures consist of spherical droplets of varying radii, from 10 to 30 Å. For example, a droplet with a radius of 25 Å can consist of 253 ion pairs.

Initial configuration placed the droplet just on top of the Si surface.

Protocols: Equilibrated silicon and ionic liquids separately.

For combined silicon and IL [Emim][BF4] systems: 

(1) Equilibrated for 20 ns at 300 K.

(2) Sampling taken every 1000 steps (2 ps) for 10 ns.
