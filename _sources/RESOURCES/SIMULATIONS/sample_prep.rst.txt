The aim of these instructions is to show you how to simulate a pure ethanoic acid liquid at 300 K. We will build a fully atomistic model with flexible bonds.
There are several possible ways to achieve the same purpose, and we will work through the simplest approach.

(1)	*Create a user configuration*
	
Use a standard third party modelling software to build a single ethanoic acid molecule (CH\ :sub:`3`\COOH). For example, Chem3D, MS. 

.. image:: ./IMAGES/build_mol.png

Tab 'Clean' (or the equivalent according to the modelling software) to adjust atoms into a sensible conformation. Export the molecule into the mol2 format e.g. *ethanol.mol2*.

Or, copy and paste the following ethanoic_acid.mol2 file (using a text editor)

.. literalinclude:: ethanoic_MS.mol2 


.. Warning::

   Importing structures from within Materials Studio's (MS) database, then modifying elements and exporting as a .mol2 file could lead to labelling of elements that  *dl_field* cannot use, which will lead to an error when running *dl_field*.  


(2)     *Force field (FF) model setup using DL_FIELD*


**Step 1**: Open and edit a DL_FIELD control file 

Alternatively, edit the generic *dl_field.control* file already in the DL_FIELD directory.  

Use OPLS2005 force field for pure ethanoic acid liquid at the standard density of 1.05 g/cm\ :sup:`3`.
This essentially replicates the ethanol molecule (*ethanol.mol2*), then randomly orientates and replicates the molecule in the simulation box. We're using a cubic simulation box measuring
40 x 40 x 40 angstrom.
The file below shows the relevant parameters highlighted in pale yellow (which is quite difficult to detect against the pale green background!)

.. literalinclude:: dl_field.control
   :emphasize-lines: 1, 11, 13, 15, 29-31

:TIPS:

   In the Solution Maker section, the cut-off: 1.6 angstroms indicates the minimum distance between the molecules. The smaller the value, the easier it is for DL_FIELD to pack the molecule in the simulation box. Hand-waving experience shows that a value of less than 2.0 angstrom will be required to create a liquid system, depending on the density and initial structure of the molecule.
   If DL_FIELD reports a failure to pack the molecule, reduce the cut-off value and run DL_FIELD again.

.. note::

   Notice that the control file indicates all atom labels will be generated in DL_FIELD format (DL_F Notation). This is essential for carrying out atomic interaction analysis in DL_ANALYSER.
		     
		     
**Step 2**: Using a text editor open and edit the file dl_f_path (shown below) in the DL_FIELD home directory, if necessary. Make sure the path for the DL_FIELD control file is correct.

.. literalinclude:: dl_f_path.dat 
   :emphasize-lines: 9

:TIP:		     
		     
  If the DL_FIELD control file is not located in the same directory as the dl_field executable (e.g. dl_field.control above) then remember to specify the correct path to the file.

**Step 3**: Run *dl_field* for example type the following from within the **dl_f_4.5** directory::

  $: ./dl_field
  

An example section of the output to the screen while *dl_field* is running is shown below:

.. literalinclude:: DL_Field_output.dat

**Step 4**: The output can be found in the directory **output** where you will find the files: *dl_f_notation.output*, *dl_poly.CONFIG*, *dl_poly.CONTROL*, *dl_poly.FIELD*, and *readme.txt*.  Inspect the files. *dl_poly.CONFIG* contains the coordinates of all of the (ethanoic) molecules contained within a simulation box. This file is needed for DL_POLY to run the molecular dynamics simulation.

.. literalinclude:: dl_poly.config1

The molecular system can be viewed in `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ . To do this, make sure the total number of atoms is inserted into *dl_poly.CONFIG* as follows, before it's opened within the visualizer program:

:TIP:

   The total number of atoms can be found by looking at the LHS entry at the bottom of the *dl_poly.CONFIG* file. Then, insert the same value into the top RHS of the *dl_poly.CONFIG* file as shown (highlighted) below.

.. literalinclude:: dl_poly.config2
   :emphasize-lines: 2

To view the box of solvent in VMD from the command line type::
 
  $: vmd

and then load the *dl_poly.CONFIG* file using the VMD 'File' tab.  
  
Notice  that the molecules below look a 'little bit' ordered in their packing. This ordered liquid needs to be equilibrated before being sampled. Equilibration is the first part of the molecular dynamics simulation, and is covered in the next section.
