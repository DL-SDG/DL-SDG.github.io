**Overview**

This exercise will show you how to set up a solution model. If you are not familiar how to run DL_FIELD and DL_ANALYSER, see the general guidance of running the program.

*Aims*

* To simulate a solution of ethanoic acid (0.2 M concentration in water) at 300 K in a cubic box of size 60x60x60 angstroms. It's a fully atomistic model with flexible bonds.
* Ethanoic acid is the solute and water is the solvent. We intend to determine the packing of water molecules around ethanoic acid using radial distribution functions.
  
*Tools*

* DL_FIELD – force field model set up (version 4.6 and above).
* DL_POLY – molecular dynamics simulations (version 3 and above).
* DL_ANALYSER – results analysis (version 2.1 and above).

.. Note:: If you are interested only in using DL_ANALYSER,  go straight to Section 3. A HISTORY trajectory file is supplied for your convenience.

This is an exercise in simulating a box of liquid ethanoic acid from preparing the model and system set-up parameters, through running a molecular dynamics simulation, to analysing the results.
