This is the main portal that provides all things relate to practical aspects of runnning simulations. It contains the following information:

1. Example simulation control parameters used by researchers on a range of materials. Information extracted from peer-reviewed journal. Use as a guidance for your models.

2. Simulation tutorials that have been written for new users of DL_Software. Some of these tutorials show you how to setup, run and analyse the system models.
