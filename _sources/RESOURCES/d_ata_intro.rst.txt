D_ATA (Atom Typer and Analyser) is the latest edition to the DL_software family and it is a software analysis tool to classify, identify, annotate and
quantify atomic interactions.

**Functions**

1. Identification and annotation of the chemical nature of constituent atoms in molecular systems (Typer).

2. Identification and annotation of atomic and molecular non-bonded interactions in the system (Typer and Analyser).

3. Quantification of non-bonded interactions to rationalise the roles these interactions play in the molecular systems (Analyser).

4. Characterisation of geometrical orientation of interactions (Analyser).


**Unique features**

1. Universal atom typing (DL_F Notation), as implemented in DL_FIELD.

2. Consistent expression syntax for atomic interactions (DANAI), as partially implemented in DL_ANALYSER. 

D_ATA is in fact a product combination of these unqiue features.
