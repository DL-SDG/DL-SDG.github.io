DL_FIELD is a flexible and powerful utility software to facilitate users to setup force field (FF) models to carry out molecular simulations.

**Functions**

1. Force field model convertor: converts user's molecular models into file formats that are recognisable and ready to run in DL_POLY and Gromacs programs with minimum user's intervention.

2. Third-party file format conversions: Convert CHARMM's pdb, rtf, psf and prm files into DL_FIELD format for DL_POLY and Gromacs.  

3. Force field editor: allows users to edit or modify a FF scheme, and even produce a new FF model repertoire that is specific to a particular type of materials.

4. Full automatic atom typing and identification of chemical nature of atoms. 

**Unique features**

1. Universal atom typing (DL_F Notation)

2. Integration of various FF schemes all expressed in identical DL_FIELD format.

3. Multiple potential capabilities, such as setting up bio-inorganic models.
