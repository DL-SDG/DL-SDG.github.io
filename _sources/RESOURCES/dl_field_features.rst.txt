**Last update: December 2020 (DL_FIELD version 4.7)**

Below shows the some of the main DL_FIELD capabilities.

* Accept input configuration files in the following formats: *PDB*, *xyz* and *mol2*

* Model customisation: define rigid bodies, assign freeze, tether and bond constrain atoms.

* Force field customisation in a user-define force field (*udff*) file: define or override potential parameters and FF models

* Solvation with auto-insertion of counter ions.

* Auto setup solution and liquid systems (Solution Maker feature).

* Fully automatic universal atom typing scheme for a number of FF schemes (applicable to *xyz* and *mol2* only).

* Definition of more than one FF scheme within a molecular model (multiple potential capability).

**Available force field (FF) schemes**

* CHARMM - CHARMM22, CHARMM36 for proteins, CHARMM36 for lipids and carbohydrates, CGenFF general FF.

* AMBER - proteins, Glycam for glycans and GAFF general FF.

* OPLS2005 - for proteins and organic molecules including drug molecules.

* OPLS-CL&P - OPLS FF for ionic liquids.

* OPLS-DES - OPLS FF for deep eutectic solvents

* OPLS-AA/M - New OPLS protein FF.

* PCFF - Small organic molecules including organic polymers.

* CVFF - Small organic molecules, proteins.

* DREIDING - General FF for covalent molecules.

* INORGANIC - a collective FF term for inorganic oxides, glass, clay, zeolites, etc.

* MISC_FF - miscellaneous general FF scheme - for FF models that do not fit with any standard schemes.

* G54A7 - united atom Gromos FF. 

All FF schemes expressed in the same DL_FIELD format and the library files are located in the *lib* directory.
