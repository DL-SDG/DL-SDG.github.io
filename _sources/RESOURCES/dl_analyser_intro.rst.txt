DL_ANALYSER is a general analysis program for DL_POLY. However, DL_ANALYSER can also read other coordinate files generated in PDB or xyz. The program development concept and file structures are similar to that of DL_FIELD. 

**Functionality**

DL_ANALYSER can generate a wide variety of results for a wide range of different kinds of simulation models. All the available analysis features and options are listed in the DL_ANALYSER *control* file.

DL_ANALYSER contains the unique feature to identify, quantify and anotate detailed atomistic interactions. This is achieved by making use of the :ref:`DL_F Notation<Header_dlf_conversion>` in the FF system models generated by DL_FIELD. 

`DANAI <https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jcim.6b00323>`_ is a standard notation to describe non-bonded atomistic interactions between two functional groups. The use of DANAI notation enable DL_ANALYSER to identify and quantify the various modes of interactions for a given type of non-bonded interactions such as the H-bonds, and other types of vdw interactions.
