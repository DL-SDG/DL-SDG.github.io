System properties

The energy in an MD simulation consists of the kinetic energy:

.. math::

   E_{kin} = \frac{1}{2} \sum_i m_i v_i^2

and the potential (configurational) energy:

.. math::

   E_{pot} = U_c = \sum_i \sum_{j<i} V \left(r_{ij}\right).

with both contributions interchanging during the course of the simulation. Both properties can be tracked and ensemble-averaged as static system properties, along with:

* Temperature

.. math:: T = \frac{2 \langle E_{kin} \rangle}{3 k_B}

* Pressure

.. math:: P = N k_B T - \frac{1}{3} \Big \langle \sum_i^{N} \vec{r}_i \cdot \vec{f}_i \Big \rangle

* Specific heat

.. math:: \langle \delta \left(U_c \right) \rangle = \frac{3}{2} N k_B T \left(1 - \frac{3 N k_B}{2 C_v} \right)

noting that these values typically fluctuate during simulations and should be reported with error estimates.

The structure of a material can be described by a pair correlation function, the *radial distribution function*:

.. math:: g \left( r \right) = \frac{\langle n \left( r \right) \rangle}{4 \pi \rho r^2 \Delta r} = \frac{V}{N^2} \Bigg \langle \sum_{i=1}^{N-1} \sum_{j \neq i}^{N} \delta \left(r - r_{ij}\right) \Bigg \rangle

which can be calculated by finding distances between atom pairs and keeping count of the numbers in 'bins' of size :math:`\Delta r`, :math:`n \left( r \right)`. The radial distribution function can be related to the *structure factor*:

.. math:: S \left( k \right) = 1 + 4 \pi \rho \int_0^{\infty} \frac{\sin \left(k r\right)}{k r} \left(g \left( r \right) - 1 \right) r^2 dr

which can also be obtained experimentally from X-ray diffraction.

MD simulations can also be used to find various dynamic properties, including *mean squared displacements* (MSDs):

.. math:: \langle | \vec{r}_i \left(t\right) - \vec{r}_i \left(0\right)|^2 \rangle

and *velocity autocorrelation functions* (VAFs):

.. math:: \langle \vec{v}_i \left(t\right) \cdot \vec{v}_i \left(0\right) \rangle

both of which can be related to the diffusivity of the material:

.. math:: D = \frac{\langle | \vec{r}_i \left(t\right) - \vec{r}_i \left(0\right)|^2 \rangle}{6t} = \frac{1}{3} \int_0^{t} \langle \vec{v}_i \left(t\right) \cdot \vec{v}_i \left(0\right) \rangle dt
