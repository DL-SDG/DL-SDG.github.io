*************************
Uses and limitation of MD
*************************

MD simulations have been widely used to obtain ensemble-averaged values of various properties, such as:

* Free energy differences (of binding, solvation, interaction)
* Diffusion coefficients
* Viscosity
* Elastic constants
* Reaction rates
* Phase transition properties
* Protein folding timestep
* Structure refinement and evaluation

Non-equilibrium processes have also been modelled using MD, including:

* Energy dissipation
* Radiation damage
* Sound propagation
* Surface coating
* Nucleation (additionally using metadynamics)

The limitations of MD simulations include:

* Imperfect parameters, often fit to *particular* pressures, temperatures, pH etc.
* Use of empirical functions to evaluate atomic forces.
* Inability to exhaustively sample phase space
* Sampling errors when calculating system properties (e.g. free energies of solvation and binding are likely to be :math:`\pm` 1 kJ mol\ :math:`^{-1}`)
* Chemical bond breaking and creation not possible
* Limited charge polarisation effects (e.g. can only use fixed partial charges)

However, MD simulations are typically cheaper than experiments, being easier to set up and repeat with changes to the models, force field and/or initial conditions. As such, they can serve as an invaluable testing tool for scientists and can be used to answer hypothetical and comparative questions cheaply and more quickly than real-life experiments.
