Uses of MD
**********

MD simulations have been widely used to obtain ensemble-averaged values of various properties, such as:

* Free energy differences (of binding, solvation, interaction)
* Diffusion coefficients
* Viscosity
* Mechanical properties such as elastic constants
* Reaction rates
* Phase transition properties
* Protein folding timestep
* Structure refinement and evaluation

Non-equilibrium processes have also been modelled using MD, including:

* Energy dissipation
* Radiation damage and prticle impacts 
* Sound propagation
* Surface coating and dissolution
* Nucleation (additionally using metadynamics)
