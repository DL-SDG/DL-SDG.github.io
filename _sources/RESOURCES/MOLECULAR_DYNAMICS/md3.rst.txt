Particle trajectories
*********************

Since moving the particles changes the distances between them and thus their forces, molecular dynamics involves continuously integrating these equations of motion to obtain trajectories numerically. This leads to the overall scheme for MD simulations, shown in the diagram below and consisting of the following stages:

* Set up initial system - obtain initial positions and velocities of atoms
* Calculate atomic forces based on potential model
* Calculate particle motion from force integration
* Calculate physical properties - collect instantaneous data for statistical purposes
* Repeat until done

We can choose how to integrate the forces based on requirements for high computational speed, low memory demand, accuracy, stability (i.e. conservation of energy without drifting) and time reversibility. The use of a *symplectic* integrator provides time reversibility and long-term stability. One commonly-used integration scheme for MD simulations is Velocity Verlet (VV), which is second-order accurate (i.e. errors are proportional to the square of the timestep size :math:`\Delta t`) and updates particle positions and velocities without requiring additional memory to do so.

.. Note::
   In DL_POLY, system trajectories can be saved into a file called *HOSTORY*. To do this, the directive *traj* must be included in the *CONTROL* file.
