This page tells you how to set DL_ANALYSER up and running.

**How to obtain DL_ANALYSER**

* `DL_ANALYSER <http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_ANALYSER>`_ – results analysis program.

* DL_ANALYSER User Manual (:download:`The DL_ANALYSER User Manual <./DOCUMENTS/MAN_DL_ANALYSER_2.2.pdf>`) - Version 2.2, March 2020.

To be able to use the latest version of DL_ANALYSER you first need `to register here <http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_ANALYSER/dl_analyser>`_. Successful registration will lead to the receipt of an email with the latest version of DL_ANALYSER attached e.g. *dl_a_2.2.tar.gz*. Untar this file for example in Linux::

   $: tar -xzvf dl_a_2.2.tar.gz

.. Note::
   The number 2.2 refers to the software version, which can be different if a newer version is released. 

This will produce the DL_ANALYSER home directory *dl_a_2.2*. To compile the program, go to the *source/* directory and type the command::

   $: make

This will create the *dl_analyser* executable file in the directory called *workspace*.

**General guidance for running DL_ANALYSER**

The *workspace/* directory is where all the neccessary support files are located. This is shown as follows:

*dl_analyser.control* - This is the default DL_ANALYSER control file. It can be renamed or copied.

*dl_analyser.input* - This is the default DL_ANALYSER input file where you insert the configuration or trajectory files. It can be renamed or copied.

*atom_list_A* and *atom_list_B* - Two special files that list the individual atom indices to be selected for analysis, They are referred to atoms from Group A and Group B, respectively. 

*dl_a_path* - A file that indicates the directory paths and names of the DL_ANALYSER *control* and *input* files.

*run_dla* - A file script to run DL_ANALYSER program.


Before running DL_ANALYSER, make sure the paths for DL_ANALYSER control and input files are correct as shown in the *dl_a_path* below:

.. image:: ./PICTURES/dl_analyse_control.png

The example file *dl_a_path* above indicates both files are in the DL_ANALYSER home directory

.. Note::
   DL_ANALYSER **always** look for the file *dl_a_path*, which **must** be located in the same directory as the  *dl_analyser* executable file (the DL_ANALYSER home directory).

DL_ANALYSER can read the trajectory files in several formats: DL_POLY trajectory format (*HISTORY*), PDB, xyz, DL_POLY *CONFIG* file and any mixture of these, both in their respective native or compressed (gzip) formats. In practice, it is more common to read a serial collection of *HISTORY* files generated from the same simulation models.

If your DL_ANALYSER cannot read the .gz file, you can use the uncompressed version of the file.
A typical DL_ANALYSER input file (*dl_analyser.input*) is shown below:

.. image:: ./PICTURES/dl_analyser_input.png

.. Note:: The number (*n*) at the start of the *dl_analyser.input* file (in the above example this is 3) instructs DL_ANALYSER to read only the first *n* lines, where it expects the path contains the input trajectory files. The program will ignore anything beyond that.

The DL_ANALYSER suite version 2.2 onward also comes with a simple run script called *run_dla*. If your program is compiled with the OpenMP library (by default), then type::

  $ ./run_dla

This will run the DL_ANALYSER program using the specified number of OpenMP threads as shown in the *run_dla* script. You can change the value according to your preference.
If you run the program by typing::

  $ ./dl_analyser.exe

then the number of threads used for the OpenMP parallelisation will depend on the OS of your computer. The actual number will be reported by DL_ANALYSER when the program is run.

**Example structures**

The DL_ANALYSER software packages comes with a DL_POLY *HISTORY* example file called *HISTORY_acetic.gz*. All the supporting files, including the *dl_a_path* file are pre-set to analyse the trajectory file. It is a small ethanoic acid liquid MD trajectory file generated using DL_POLY. 

Below shows the content of the *dl_analyser.control* file:

.. literalinclude:: ./SIMULATIONS/dl_analyser.control
   :emphasize-lines: 6, 8, 15, 25, 26, 30, 39


The highlighted lines are examples of what you might want to change in the file, e.g.

* The number 5392 is the total atoms in the system.
* The word ‘auto’ means DL_ANALYSER will determine the periodic boundary conditions based on the cell vectors from the trajectory files.
* The Interaction Analysis Section is where the H-bond analysis is specified.
* The *test1.out* is the results output file.

.. Note:: All DL_ANALYSER runs will always produce a file called *dl_analyser.output* in the *workspace/* directory, which reports the analysis status, and  output files of the results according to what you specified in the DL_ANALYSER *control* file.


Now, type *./run_dla* or *./dl_analyser* and see what happens.
