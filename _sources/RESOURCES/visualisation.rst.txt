.. This describes a few different software tools for visualisation and model-building

Model Building and Visualization Software
*****************************************



The first step of atomistic modelling usually involves building and/or visualising a system. For this there is a variety of software available, some examples of which are given below.

**Model Building**

* `Materials Studio <https://www.3dsbiovia.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-materials-studio/visualization-and-statistics-software.html>`_ This is proprietary software requiring access to a (paid) licence. It has many capabilities and is especially useful for building multi-component, periodic systems such as adsorbates on a mineral surface.

* `Chem3D <http://www.cambridgesoft.com/support/ProductHomePage.aspx?KBCatID=112>`_ This is also proprietary software and '..enables synthetic chemists and biologists to generate 3D models of small molecules and biochemical compounds..'

* `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ Visual Molecular Dynamics software is free and useful for '..displaying, animating and analyzing...'

* `AtomEye <http://li.mit.edu/Archive/Graphics/A/>`_ This atomistic configuration viewer is free

* `VESTA <http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/>`_ Visualization for Electronic and STructural Analysis -it's free and '..s a 3D visualization program for structural models, volumetric data such as electron/nuclear densities, and crystal morphologies.'

*  `ATEN: <https://www.projectaten.com/>`_  DL_POLY compatible molecular graphics viewer and editor, written by Tristan Youngs 

* `A comprehensive list <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_software_for_molecular_mechanics_modeling>`_ linking to Wikipedia


* `Ionic Liquids FF DL_POLY I/O setup utility <https://github.com/agiliopadua/ilff>`_ using Canongia-Lopes & PÃ¡dua FF, a  de-facto, standard FF for many ionic liquids

* `Software to assist with molecular dynamics simulations <https://webpages.ciencias.ulisboa.pt/~cebernardes/Software.html>`_  (by C. Bernardes)

  
**Visualization and Analysis**  

A few examples include:

* `Materials Studio <https://www.3dsbiovia.com/products/collaborative-science/biovia-materials-studio/visualization-and-statistics-software.html>`_

* `VMD <https://www.ks.uiuc.edu/Research/vmd/>`_ 'VMD is a molecular visualization program for displaying, animating, and analyzing large biomolecular systems using 3-D graphics and built-in scripting.'

* `VESTA <http://jp-minerals.org/vesta/en/>`_  '3D visualization program for structural models, volumetric data such as electron/nuclear densities, and crystal morphologies.'

* `OVITO <https://www.ovito.org/>`_ This is free and is a '.. scientific visualization and analysis software for atomistic and particle simulation data.'
  
* `XCrySDen <http://www.xcrysden.org/>`_ This is a '..crystalline and molecular structure visualisation program aiming at display of isosurfaces and contours, which can be superimposed on crystalline structures and interactively rotated and manipulated.'

*  `dlputils <https://www.projectaten.com/dlputils>`_ '..collection of small utilities that will calculate various properties from molecular dynamics trajectories, as well as allow for some manipulation of those trajectories'

* `Travis Software <http://www.travis-analyzer.de/>`_ General-purpose trajectory visualiser, that works with DL_POLY HISTORY files `Reference paper <https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/ci200217w>`_  

* `Paraview <https://www.paraview.org/>`_ This is 'an open-source, multi-platform data analysis and visualization application' ideal for visualising and analysing data-based datasets, including Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) trajectories from DL_MESO_LBE and some analysis results (e.g. localised properties, density maps) from DL_MESO_DPD.
