The following is a list of the molecular simulation software tools you need to complete the Simulation Tutorials. The descriptions include details on how to obtain the software - **if you are a new user of DL_Software it is strongly recommended you read the following before attempting any of the Simulation Tutorials**  

* `DL_FIELD <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_FIELD.aspx>`_ – force field model set up (version 4.5 and above).

To be able to use DL_FIELD you first need to register `here <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_FIELD.aspx>`_. Successful registration will lead to you receiving a .tar.gz file (e.g. dl_f_4.5.tar.gz). Unpack or untar this for example in Linux::

  $: tar -xzvf dl_f_4.5.tar.gz

This will produce the directory **dl_f_4.5** which contains a *dl_field.control*, *dl_f_path* and a **README.md** file (amongst other files). You then need to compile to produce the executable *dl_field*. To do this follow the simple instructions in the **README.md** file. The file that will need to be edited to run the executable *dl_field* specific to your simulation is *dl_field.control*. 

:TIP:

   If you work from within the **dl_f_4.5** directory the only file that will need to be edited to run the executable *dl_field* is *dl_field.control*. Working from a directory other than **dl_f_4.5** is not recommended until you feel confident about changing file paths (e.g. in *dl_f_path*).

* `DL_POLY <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY.aspx>`_ – molecular dynamics simulations (version 4.09 and above).

To be able to use the latest version of DL_POLY you first need to `register here <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY-Registration.aspx>`_. Successful registration will lead to you receiving an email containing instructions on how to download the latest version of DL_POLY. Following the instructions in the email from CCP5-ADMIN should give you an unzipped directory (e.g. **dl_poly_4.09**).
The next step is to compile a dl_poly executable. If you want to compile an executable that runs on more than one core i.e. an mpi version to run on a high performance computing (HPC) system, first transfer the dl_poly directory to the HPC and type the commands below (example given for a bash terminal) adapting if necessary for specific HPC::
  
  $: cd dl_poly_4.09
  $: mkdir build-mpi
  $: cd build-mpi
  $: module load cmake gcc7 openmpi-gcc7
  $: FFLAGS="-O3" FC=gfortran cmake ../
  $: make –j8    (where 8 is the number of processes used to compile the executable)

Succesful compilation leads to the creation of the dl_poly executable (**DLPOLY.Z**), which can be found in **dl_poly_4.09/build-mpi/bin/**.

:TIP:
   Copy the executable *DLPOLY.Z* to the directory from where you will run simulations e.g.::

     $ cd DL_POLY_SIMULATION
     $ cp dl_poly_4.09/build-mpi/bin/DLPOLY.Z .

.. Note::

   The exact name of the DL_POLY directory will depend on the version you have downloaded. At the time of writing this, the latest version was dl_poly_4.09.

**Continuation runs of simulations**

When you need to re-run a simulation make a 'copy script' using a text editor that can be used to quickly copy the CONFIG, REVCON and REVIVE files as shown below (in the same order)::

     $: emacs copy.sh  # this creates a new script file using the emacs text editor

.. literalinclude:: dlpoly_script.sh 

Then ensure the script is executable::
  
    $: chmod +x dlpoly_script.sh

and to run it::
  
    $: ./copy.sh

* `DL_ANALYSER <http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_ANALYSER>`_ – results analysis (version 2.1 and above).


To be able to use the latest version of DL_ANALYSER you first need `to register here <http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_ANALYSER/dl_analyser>`_. Succesful registration will lead to the receipt of an email with the latest version of DL_ANALYSER attached e.g. *dl_analyser_2.1.tar.gz*. Untar this file (see above for example) and follow the instructions in the **readme.txt**. The compiled version *dl_analyser* will be found in the folder **workspace** together with other files including *dl_analyser.control*.

:TIP:
   If you are not familiar with changing the names of filepaths, then create a directory within **workspace** and move or copy DL_POLY output *HISTORY* files into it for analysis, e.g.::
     
     $ cd workspace
     $ mkdir ETHANOIC_ACID_ANALYSIS
     $ cp ../../../../ETHANOIC_ACID/DL_POLY_output/HISTORY* .

  (Where the directory names above are examples)
