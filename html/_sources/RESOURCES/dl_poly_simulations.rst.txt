Examples of DL_POLY Simulations
*******************************

* DL_POLY simulation of `formic acid on calcite surface <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ojw_LJNR9f8>`_ (film made with `ATEN <http://www.projectaten.com/>`_ and `ffmpeg <https://www.ffmpeg.org/>`_ all on `opensuse <https://opensuse.org>`_ )

 |
 
* Using DL_POLY Classic and visualized with VMD - `Rhyolitic Magma Simulations <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jmGjGCgygMQ>`_
* `Classical music soundtrack <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=06h_dhQsbx4>`_ (The simulations are based on the work of N. Sator and B. Guillot)

|
  
* `Absorption of formic acid onto a calcite surface <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9IvJgTbzml0>`_ (no sound, DL_POLY exercise)

|
  
* `Potassium capture by valinomycin <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mUqRLxU6Zaw>`_ (No sound, material from a DL_POLY tutorial)
