Simulation Run
##############

**Step 1**: It is important to rename the files output by DL_FIELD:

 * Rename *dl_poly.CONFIG* to **CONFIG**

 * Rename *dl_poly.FIELD* to **FIELD**

 * Rename *dl_poly.CONTROL* to **CONTROL**

**Step 2**: *Equilibration in DL_POLY*

 * Edit the **CONTROL** file, making the necessary changes (see CONTROL1).
   This **CONTROL** file instructs DL_POLY to run 200,000 MD steps at NVE ensemble, rescale the temperature to exactly 300K at every MD step. Using the variable timestep directive, enables  DL_POLY to adjust the suitable timestep accordingly, especially at the early stage of simulation.  This ensures the system dynamics are in control for high-energy conformations.
   

.. literalinclude:: CONTROL1

Run the equilibration in DL_POLY::

 $: ./dl_field

Repeat step 2 if necessary, by increasing the number of MD steps.    
		    
   
.. figure:: ./IMAGES/STATIS_CONT1.png

   The figure above shows samples from the start (**LHS**) and end (**RHS**) of the STATIS file output from using the parameters as detailed in CONTROL1. The highlighted numbers show the total energy of the system -see how it fluctuates hugely at the beginning of the simulation and becomes more stable towards the end of the 200,000 steps.

   
**Step 3**: *Checking your system is equilibrated*

 *  Check that the configurational energy values fluctuate around a mean value, when this has occurred equilibration has been reached. You can check this in the top entry of the LHS column of the **STATIS** file as shown above where the total energies are highlighted.

 *  When you are satisfied a mean total energy value has been reached, reset the directive equilibration steps in the **CONTROL** file to zero. (See CONTROL2). Check if the energy values are steady without  rescaling the temperature at approximately 300 K.

    .. literalinclude:: CONTROL2

   Check if the energy values are steady without  rescaling the temperature at approximately 300 K.
			
.. figure:: ./IMAGES/STATIS_CONT2.png

  The figure above shows the temperature at the beginning of the re-run (**LHS**) - which for the first run was fixed at 300 K - and at the end (**RHS**), where the temperature decreases from ~310 K to ~304 K during the last three of the 400,000 MD steps. It is up to the user to decide if the temperature is sufficiently stable for their simulation.     

   


* Change to ensemble NPT to equilibrate the simulation box size (see CONTROL3), using *restart noscale*. If a further run is needed, restart the simulation and increase the MD steps in the **CONTROL** file.
		    
    .. literalinclude:: CONTROL3


.. figure:: ./IMAGES/STATIS_CONT3.png

   The figure above shows the simulation box lengths x, y, z (highlighted) at the beginning of the simulation (**LHS**) and at the end (**RHS**). After 100,000 steps of MD simulation the cell lengths remain at ~ 40 angstrom	    
			
   
.. warning::
   Remember to run the copy script (e.g. *copy.sh* in the Resources/Molecular Simulations- Tools section)  after each MD run, before carrying on for the next run. THEN edit the CONTROL file to increase the number of timesteps (which is cumulative).
   
.. Note::

   Changing the timestep value, or changing from variable to fixed timestep, or changing the ensemble necessitates using the *restart noscale* directive in the **CONTROL** for the first run.
   This instructs DL_POLY to restart a fresh MD run, which starts at 0 MD time and where the initial velocities of the system are derived from the **CONFIG** file. After that, ‘noscale’ needs to be removed if you want to run more MD steps. The directive *noscale* instructs DL_POLY to start a fresh simulation where the MD time starts from zero, and the initial velocity information  is taken from the **CONFIG** file, rather than generated randomly.


**Step 4**: *Sampling Run in DL_POLY (CONTROL4)*

 * Using the final **CONFIG** file from step 3, do the sampling run by producing the **HISTORY** trajectory files (see **CONTROL4**). Again, the directive *restart noscale* is used, to ensure the MD time starts from zero as the **HISTORY** file is produced. A fixed timestep of 0.0005 ps (0.5 fs) is also used.The directive *traj 1 200 0* means the system configuration will be written out every 200 MD steps and contains only the positions of the atoms (this excludes velocities and forces). 


.. literalinclude:: CONTROL4

		    
After the first sampling run, remember to remove the 'noscale' directive in the **CONTROL** before doing a further run. For each successive run, the trajectory will append onto the existing **HISTORY** file.

.. figure:: ./IMAGES/HISTORY1.png
 
    The figure above shows the **HISTORY** output at the beginning (**LHS**) and end (**RHS**) of the first sampling run of 100,000 MD steps. It's up to the user to decide the length of the required simulation sampling run.


:TIP:

   Rather  than producing one large **HISTORY** file, after each run, the **HISTORY** file can be renamed serially (for instance **HISTORY1**, **HISTORY2**, etc). In this way, the next simulation run will produce a new **HISTORY** file.

Finally, when you are satisfied the simulation sampling run is complete, copy the REVCON file to CONFIG (or use the latest HISTORY file) and view it in VMD e.g. ::
  
  $: cp REVCON CONFIG
  $: vmd &

.. image:: ./IMAGES/liquid_box_final.png
   :scale: 50%
	   
Note how there is a complete lack of order in the output configuration (contrast this with the output from DL_FIELD in the Section *Sample Preparation*.
