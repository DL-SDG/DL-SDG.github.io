Sample Preparation
******************

**Step 1: Setting up the Force field (FF) model using DL_FIELD**

Open and edit a DL_FIELD control file (or use *dl_field.control1* in this example). The relevant changes are highlighted in yellow below.



(i) Start with a single molecule configuration (e.g. ethanoic.mol2 found in :ref:`structures-label`). 

(ii) Use the Solution Maker feature in DL_FIELD to set up the solution model: A concentration of 0.2 M (mol/dm\ :sup:`3`) is specified in the Solution Maker section. DL_FIELD will calculate the closest integral number of ethanoic acid molecules needed to make up the concentration based on the given simulation box size, which in this example, is a cubic of size 60 angstrom.

   :emphasize-lines: 1, 11, 13, 15, 29-31

The solute molecules are duplicated and randomly orientated in the box, each solute molecule is at least 15 angstrom apart (critical distance, or cut-off distance) from one another.

:TIP: The smaller the critical distance, the easier it is for DL_FIELD to pack the molecules into the simulation box. Larger critical distances mean the solutes are more dispersed in the simulation box. A low concentration of 0.2 M as shown in this example means DL_FIELD will insert fewer ethanoic acid molecules in the system and therefore can tolerate a larger range of cut-off values.

The choice of a suitable value for the cut-off distance depends on several factors: size and shape of solutes and desired concentration. Note that choosing a small distance for low-concentration systems will likely result in a less disperse solute with molecules residing at certain regions in the system.

:TIP: If DL_FIELD reports a failure to pack the molecule, reduce the cut-off (critical) value and run DL_FIELD again.

.. Note::
      By means of trial and error, it turns out that a cut off distance of 15 angstrom is large enough to give relatively dispersed molecules in the system. Notice the control file -it indicates all atom labels will be generated in the DL_FIELD format (DL_F Notation), which provides chemically-sensitive information.


**Step 2: Running DL_FIELD**

When running DL_FIELD using the above mentioned *dl_field.control1* file, the following information will be displayed on the screen:

The value '26' indicates the actual number of ethanoic acid molecules inserted in the given simulation box size, which is the number needed to produce a concentration of 0.2 mol/dm\ :sup:`3` in the system. The molecule size of 3.837930 angstrom (3 times the radius of gyration) provides a rough indication of the size of the molecule.

**Step 3: Optional - Validating the solute packing of ethanoic acid molecules**

You can skip this step if how the molecules are packed is not important to you. For solution models, you generally want to ensure you get well dispersed solute molecules.

:TIP: You can view the outcome of the model setup - *dl_poly.CONFIG* -  using VMD. Remember to insert the total number of atoms in the dl_poly.CONFIG file.

If you are not satisfied with the way how the molecules are arranged in the box, adjust the cut off value in the control file (e.g. *dl_field.control1*) and rerun DL_FIELD. Note that the molecule orientations and positions will always change after each run, and so you will NOT be able to get identical configurations.


**Step 4: Solvating the systems**

Edit the control file (e.g. *dl_field.control1*) and insert the solvent choice as follows (or use *dl_field.control2* file. Remember to change the control filename in dl_f_path). The only change is highlighted in yellow:

.. image:: ./IMAGES/dl_field_control2.png


Run DL_FIELD. In this case, once the solute molecules are duplicated in the box, DL_FIELD will populate the space with the solvent molecules, with the original TIP3P water model (TIP3P_O). Where water molecules that are closer to the solute than the cutoff distance of 2.0 angstrom will be removed.

The following additional information will be given in *dl_field.output*.

.. Note::
   You can use *dl_field.control2* to generate the solution model in one step: randomly place the solute molecules, and then add the water solvent!
