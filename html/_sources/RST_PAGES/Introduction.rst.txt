DL_Software is a collective term for a number of scientific software packages developed by a group of dedicated scientists from `Computational Chemistry Group <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/Computational-Chemistry-Group.aspx>`_ at Daresbury Laboratory that implements state-of-the-art simulation methods - from atomistic, through mesoscopic scale modelling. The software codes 
offer great flexibility to handle a wide variety of system models, exploiting advanced software algorithms,
set-up designs and post-processing analytics.

The DL_Software Digital Guide (DL_SDG) is intended to be a one-stop resource centre for DL_Software users. You will find tutorials, modelling procedures, tips, pit falls to watch out for the range of codes with examples of input and output. 
This an attempt to enable users (particularly new users) to get themselves up-and-running with the particular DL_Software that gets their science done.
