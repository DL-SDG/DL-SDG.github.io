Introduction
************

This is intended to be a resource centre for new users of DL_Software. You will find a set of tutorials for the range of codes with examples of input and output. The suite of Daresbury Laboratory computational modelling software (i.e. DL_Software) has been developed over the last twenty years, and there is already a wealth of material about the software available online, some of which can be accessed directly from this resource centre.
This an attempt to enable users (particularly new users) to get themselves up-and-running with the particular DL_Software that gets their science done.

As you work your way through the material available in the resource centre you will find variously coloured boxes like those shown below:

.. Note::
   These are grey boxes describing important pieces of information of which the user should be aware

.. Warning::
   These are pale red boxes describing information that should be not ignored!

:TIP:
   These are (hopefully!) helpful hints to enable ease-of-use or understanding. They are marked by the presence of a pale purple box that extends down the left hand side of the page aligned with the text.

This is the 'Further Reading' icon indicating extra material that you might find useful, but that is not essential for the new user.


All of the above will appear in various places throughout the resource centre; here's a tip for you to try out:

*  `DL_POLY <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_POLY.aspx>`_ - a general purpose classical molecular dynamics (MD)  simulation software developed by IT Todorov and W Smith. It is  capable of handling 'large' molecular systems (i.e. > 100,000 atoms) 

 - `DL_FIELD <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_FIELD.aspx>`_ - a force-field construction tool built for DL_POLY by CW Yong

|

 - `DL_ANALYSER <http://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_ANALYSER>`_ - a general analysis tool built for DL_POLY's trajectory files by CW Yong

|

* `DL_MONTE <https://www.ccp5.ac.uk/DL_MONTE>`_    - a general purpose parallel Monte Carlo simulation package developed by John Purton, Nigel Wilding and Steve Parker

|

* `DL_MESO <https://www.scd.stfc.ac.uk/Pages/DL_MESO.aspx>`_  - a general purpose mesoscale simulation package developed by Michael Seaton. It supports both Lattice Boltzmann Equation (LBE) and Dissipative Particle Dynamics (DPD)

|

* `CHEMSHELL <https://www.chemshell.org/>`_ - a scriptable computational chemistry environment with support for hybrid QM/MM simulations for mutliscale modelling. Hybrid QM/MM is its main strength
