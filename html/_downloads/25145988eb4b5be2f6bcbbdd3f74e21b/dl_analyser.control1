==========================================================================
Note: 
This is DL_ANALYSER control file.

DO NOT remove nor alter the headings start with '---'. 

Reads the following input file format (define in dl_analyser.input file):
HISTORY, PDB, CONFIG, xyz, STATIS
Some analysis options may not be applicable depending on the input file format and the amount 
of data it contains.


(1) Units for length = Angstrom, temperature = Kelvin.

(2) Must define at least one set of atom range (Group A) for analysis.
    Depending on analysis options selected, Group B atoms may be needed. 

(3) Analysis type:
    1 = atom-base. This means analysis is carried out base on individual atoms, whenever possible.
    2 = molecule-base. This means analysis is carried out base on individual molecules, whenever possible.
    For example, in radial distribution function, G(r), the atom-base analysis would need to define 
    two atom labels. If molecule-base analysis is chosen, then atom labels will be ignored. Instead, the
    center of mass  of individual molecules are determined and G(r) is calculated based on the CG values. 
    Use Molecules A1, A2 (Group A), or B1, B2 (Group B) as labels.

(3) Defect analysis can be applied for both surface and bulk models
    vacant - no atom around the original site.
    original - original atom index around the original site.
    new occupancy - original site is occupied by other atom index.
    interstitial - two or more atoms occupy a sphere around an original site.
                   Also all other atoms that locate outside of all spheres
                   around sites.
    above surface - Atoms that locate beyond the surface defintion (top and
                    bottom). This is meaningful only for surface model.
    Suggested value for the cutoff RADIUS for defect analysis: NN*0.5
    (NN = nearest neighbour)

(4) Sputter analysis is for surface model only.
    adatoms - Atoms or groups of atoms that locate BEYOND the surface 
              region that stick to the surface, determine by the NN
              cutoff distance measures from the surface threshold.
    sputtered - Atoms or groups of atoms which center of gravity pass the
                sputtering threshold AND, if force is available, with resultant
                force direct away from surface.
                Once it (atoms or clusters) is sputtered, it will always
                considered sputtered. No further analysis will be carried out.
    interface - particles that are located between the surface region and the sputter threshold.

(5) Surface region is defined by the thickness specify, which spans along surface normal,
    and centred around the surface threshold (top and bottom of the threshold). 

    --------------------------------------------     (upper limit of surface region)
    ^
    | thickness      SURFACE REGION
    | ---------------------------------------------  (surface threshold)
    |                SURFACE REGION
    V
    --------------------------------------------     (lower limit of surface region)

(6) Sputtering threshold is the distance from the Surface definition. 
    E.g.: If Surface definition is 1.0x and -20.0x and the Sputtering threshold
    is 5.0 then the real distance beyond which atoms are considered sputter is
    1.0 + 5.0 and -20.0 - 5.0 in x direction.

(7) Once atoms are sputtered will always considered sputter. The sputtering
    threshold therefore must be chosen with care as some ejected atoms may
    eventually fall back to the surface as adatoms or reenter surface bulk.

(8) Extra information may be needed for certain calculations:
    Molecular matching - template file (in xyz, DL_ANALYSER format)
    Correlation displacement - atom index file. Just list a row of atom numbers
                             - it indicates which atoms will be used for the calculations.
 
(9) For C(ij) calculation - cross correlation displacement.
    Atom range specified above must start from 1 onwards. 
    This is to make sure atom index match with those in input trajectory files.
    Only Group A atoms will be analysed. Group B, even if defined will be ignored.
